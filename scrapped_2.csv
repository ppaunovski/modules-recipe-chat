13,acorn,oaknut,"These nuts come from oak trees, and they were once an important food for Native Americans.   Before they can be eaten, most acorns need to be treated to remove the bitter tannins in them.   To do this, boil whole shelled acorns in water, replacing the water with fresh boiling water whenever it turns light brown. Keep doing this for about two hours, until the water no longer changes color.   Alternatively, you can soak the shelled acorns in several changes of water for three or four days.  Some Native Americans do this by putting whole or pounded acorns into nylon stockings and hanging them so that they're immersed in the water of a toilet tank (repeat:  tank, not bowl).  Each time the toilet is flushed, the water in the tank is refreshed.  This may discolor the toilet, however.  After the nuts have been leached of tannins, roast them in a 350° oven for about an hour.  They can then be eaten whole or ground into acorn meal and used to make porridges or breads.  Acorns from white oaks aren't nearly as bitter as those from red or black oaks, and can be roasted without first soaking them.","['hazelnut', 'chestnut']",Quercus
14,acorn squash,"Des Moines squash, pepper squash","This orange-fleshed winter squash is popular because of its small size--it can be cut in half and baked to make two generous servings. The rind, unfortunately, is quite hard and difficult to cut.

16,active dry yeast,,"This is the yeast called for by most bread recipes.

To activate it, sprinkle it on water that's 105° - 115° F and wait for it to begin foaming (about five minutes).  Look for it in the dairy case--it's usually sold in strips of three packages or in 4-ounce jars.  Always check the expiration date to make sure it's fresh.  Dry yeast can be stored at room temperature until the expiration date--or within 4 months of opening--but it lasts even longer in the refrigerator or freezer.  Always bring yeast to room temperature before you use it.   It's important to keep stored yeast away from air and moisture, so use the smallest container you can find and seal it well.","['fresh yeast', 'instant yeast', 'bread machine yeast']",

21,agar,"agar agar, agar-agar, angel's hair, Chinese gelatin, Chinese isinglass, dai choy goh, Japanese gelatin, Japanese isinglass, kanten, vegetable gelatin","Since gelatin is made from animal tissue, many vegetarians rely upon this seaweed derivative as a substitute.  Like ordinary gelatin, agar is flavorless and becomes gelatinous when it's dissolved in water, heated, and then cooled.   Agar, though, gels more firmly than gelatin, and it sets and melts at a higher temperature--it can even set at room temperature.  Agar, like gelatin, is full of protein (though incomplete), but it also contains the rich array of minerals one would expect from seaweed.   To use agar, just soak it in the liquid for about 15 minutes, bring it to a gentle boil, then simmer while stirring until it's completely dissolved.  The liquid will gel as it cools.  Acids weakens agar's gelling power, so if you're firming an acidic liquid, use more.  Like gelatin, agar will break down if exposed to the enzymes of certain raw fruits, like kiwi fruit, papayas, pineapple, peaches, mangos, guavas, and figs.  Cooking these fruits, though, destroys the enzymes.  If you plan to add any of these fruits to a gelatin salad, it's a good idea to buy them in cans, since all canned fruit is pre-cooked.

These two compounds react when they get wet and release carbon dioxide gas bubbles. These, in turn, cause baked goods to rise.  Baking powder is perishable. To test a batch, add 1 teaspoon to ½ cup hot water. If it doesn't bubble, throw it out.  Look for baking powder among the baking supplies in most supermarkets.
Most recipes that call for baking powder intend for you to use double-acting baking powder.  This includes two acidic salts--one that reacts when wet and one that reacts heated.  By giving the baking soda two chances to react, it usually results in light and airy baked goods.  Less common is single-acting baking powder, which only reacts when it becomes wet. When using this kind of baking powder, you have to get the batter into a preheated oven immediately after you mix the wet and dry ingredients together.  Aluminum-free baking powder is preferred by many cooks; powders made with aluminum lend an unpleasant flavor to delicately-flavored baked goods","['cream of tartar', 'cream of tartar', 'buttermilk', 'molasses', ""baker's ammonia""]",
119,baking soda,"bicarb, bicarbonate of soda, bread soda, sodium bicarbonate","Baking soda is alkaline, and when mixed with acidic ingredients, it reacts and releases bubbles of carbon dioxide.  These bubbles, when trapped inside batter, help baked goods rise.  Baking powder contains baking soda, along with acidic salts that react with the soda when they get wet or heated.   Recipes that call for both baking powder and baking soda are probably using the baking soda to offset extra acidity in the batter (from ingredients like buttermilk or molasses) and to weaken the proteins in the flour.  Omitting the baking soda from these recipes may alter the color or flavor of whatever you're baking, and make it less tender.
Tips: Baking soda is used in devil's food cake because it turns the cocoa powder reddish brown.  
Vegetables cooked in water mixed with baking soda don't lose as much color, though the baking soda makes them mushier and causes them to lose vitamin C.  
Sprinkling baking soda on a grease or electrical fire will help extinguish it.
Placing an opened box in the refrigerator or freezer will absorb bad odors 
Baking soda is a good, mildly abrasive scouring powder.

121,bread machine yeast,,"This type of dry yeast is highly active and very finely granulated so that it hydrates quickly.  Breads made with this yeast require only a single rise, so this yeast is handy to use in a bread machine.  Most machines will have you add this yeast last, on top of the dry ingredients.  If you're not using a bread machine, add this yeast to the flour and other dry ingredients.   It's often sold in 4-ounce jars.  You can store unopened jars at room temperature until the expiration date stamped on the jar, but the yeast lasts even longer in the refrigerator or freezer.

If you object to the bitterness, try nutritional yeast, which is made from the same yeast strain but grown on molasses.  It's more expensive but has a more pleasant flavor.  You can also buy debittered brewer's yeast.  Brewer's yeast comes powdered (the most potent form), in flakes (best for health shakes), and in tablets.

It works faster and longer than active dry yeast, but it's very perishable and loses potency a few weeks after it's packed.  It's popular among commercial bakers, who can keep ahead of the expiration dates, but home bakers usually prefer dry yeast.  To use, soften the cake in a liquid that's 70° - 80° F.

Unlike ordinary active dry yeast, instant yeast doesn't need to be dissolved in liquid first--you just add it to the dry ingredients.  Look for it in the dairy case--it's usually sold in strips of three packages or in 4-ounce jars.   Before buying it, check the expiration date to make sure it's fresh.

Nutritional yeast is very similar to brewer's yeast, which is also used as a nutritional supplement and is made from the same strain of yeast.  The difference is that brewer's yeast is a by-product of beer production and retains some of the bitter flavor of hops.

A small amount of alcohol is also produced, but this burns off as the bread bakes.   Beer yeast and wine yeast are used to convert sugar into alcohol and, in the case of beer and champagne, bubbles.  You should never eat raw active yeast, since it will continue to grow in your intestine and rob your body of valuable nutrients.

134,yeast starter,"biga, poolish, Sourdough starter","A starter is a mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients that's been colonized by wild airborne yeast and friendly bacteria.  These one-celled immigrants lend the starter--and the breads made with it--a special character.  Sourdough starter, for example, contains a strain of yeast that's tolerant of the lactic and acetic acids produced by the lactobacilli.  Those acids give sourdough bread its characteristic tang.  The French use a soupy starter called a poolish to make their breads, while the Italians use a thicker one called a biga.  Up until the late 19th century, all yeast breads were leavened with starters, and keeping a starter alive in its crock was a routine household chore.  To keep your own starter alive, wait until it's established, then store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.  To keep it healthy, bring it to room temperature once a week and remove all but about 25% of it (either make bread with it or discard it).  Replace what you've taken with a mixture of equal parts warm water and flour, stir, then return it to the refrigerator.  Properly maintained, a starter can last for decades, developing an ever more distinctive character as it ages.   To use a starter to make bread, remove some of it (usually about 2 cups), and use it in place of other forms of yeast.  Replace the amount you took with a mixture of equal parts flour and warm water.  Discard your starter if it becomes orange or pink, or if it develops an unpleasant odor.   It's easy to make starters from scratch, but even easier to borrow some from a friend.  Since sourdough starters must be colonized by strains of yeast and lactobacilli that are particular to certain regions (like San Francisco), a homemade starter might not yield sour bread.   Your best bet is to get a powdered sourdough starter mix from your supermarket or a mail order supplier.",['flour'],

Please consider using roe from more abundant species until the Caspian Sea sturgeon populations can recover.Caviar is known for its subtle, buttery flavor, sensuous texture, and high price. It should always be served cold.Just as diamonds are rated according to the four Cs, caviar can be evaluated by the three Fs--flavor, firmness, and freshness. The flavor of caviar depends on the sturgeon's species and habitat, and is variously described as buttery, nutty, sweet, fruity, earthy, briny, and even herbaceous. The firmness of each egg determines how the eggs burst when you squeeze them against the roof of your mouth with your tongue. Fresh caviar is considered much better than the pasteurized version.Varieties: (from highest to lowest price) imperial caviar, beluga caviar, ossetra caviar, and sevruga caviar. Imperial caviar is the rarest and most expensive. Beluga caviar is soft, and almost melts in your mouth. Ossetra and sevruga caviars are relatively firm, and will pop when gently squeezed. Within these categories, malossol, or lightly salted caviar, is of higher quality than pressed caviar = payusnaya.If substituting an inferior caviar, consider perking it up with a splash of fresh lemon juice.Equivalents: 2 tablespoons = 1 ounceFresh caviar lasts just over a year if properly stored, though its shelf-life can be extended with heavy salting. Experts claim that some of the fresh caviar that's being sold at bargain prices over the Internet is well past its prime.

Arrowroot also imparts a shiny gloss to foods, and while it can make a dessert sauce glow spectacularly, it can make a meat sauce look eerie and fake.
