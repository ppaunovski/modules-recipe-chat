Raw olives must be cured before they can be eaten, and the curing medium--usually lye, brine, or salt--affects their flavor and texture.  So too does the olive's degree of ripeness when it's picked.  Green olives are picked while unripe, which makes them denser and more bitter than brown or black olives, which stay on the tree until fully ripened.   Olives become bitter if they're cooked too long, so always add them to hot dishes at the last minute.

494,vine tomato,"For best flavor, tomatoes should stay on the vine until they're fully ripened.  This is a tall order for growers, who prefer to pick tomatoes while they're still green and sturdy, and then gas them with ethylene until they turn red.  Vine tomatoes, on the other hand, are picked after they begin to ""break"" or turn red, which allows them to develop fuller flavor.  Expect to pay more for the special handling required to bring these to market.",vine-ripened tomato,Solanum lycopersicum,['slicing tomato']
495,watermelon,"There are about 50 varieties of watermelon on the market. They all taste about the same, but they vary in size, flesh color, and in whether they are seeded or seedless. Picnic melons are largest, while icebox melons are round and compact. Many stores also carry yellow-fleshed, white-fleshed, and seedless melons. The rind should be heavy for its size, and free of bruises, soft spots, or cuts. To check for ripeness, look at the pale side of the melon (where it rested while it was growing)--it should be yellow, not white. If your market sells halved watermelons, inspect the flesh--it should be firm, brightly colored, and free of white streaks. Seeded watermelons should have dark brown or black seeds. To store, wrap watermelon slices loosely in plastic and refrigerate for up to two days. Uncut watermelon can be stored at room temperature (preferably in a cool spot) for up to two weeks.","icebox melons, Picnic melons, seedless melons, white-fleshed melons, yellow-fleshed melons",Citrullus lanatus,['honeydew melon']
