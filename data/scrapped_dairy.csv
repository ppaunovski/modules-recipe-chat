59,cream,"Creams vary according to the amount of butterfat they have. Lightest of all is half & half, which is half milk, half cream and weighs in with a butterfat content between 10.5 - 18%.  It can't be whipped, but it's nice with coffee, or on cereal.  Light cream = coffee cream = table cream is richer at 18 - 30% fat, but it still can't be whipped.  Light whipping cream = whipping cream (with a butterfat content of 30 - 36%) and heavy cream = heavy whipping cream (with at least 36% fat) are heavy enough to whip, and aren't as prone as lower-fat creams to curdling in sauces. The higher the butterfat content, the less beating is required to get whipped cream.  Europeans go for even heavier creams, like double cream (with a butterfat content of 42%), extra-thick double cream, and clotted cream = Devonshire cream, which is often spread like butter over scones. Look for clotted cream in large supermarkets, but (perhaps luckily) the double creams are very hard to find.

It comes in low-fat and nonfat versions; these work well as spreads but compromise the flavor and texture of cheesecakes.  Cream cheese made without stabilizers is also disappointing in cheesecakes, though it makes for a more acidic and flavorful spread.  Store in the refrigerator.

Egg yolks make wonderful thickeners--imparting both a rich flavor and velvety smooth texture--but they're tricky to use.  You can't just whisk them into a simmering sauce--they'd curdle on contact.  Instead, you need to ""temper"" them by adding some of the hot liquid to the egg yolks, whisking the mixture together, and then adding it to the sauce.  To prevent the yolks from coagulating, you need to keep the sauce below 190°, although this rule can be broken if the sauce has a lot of flour in it.

Raw milk isn't pasteurized; producers instead keep their cows and dairies clean in order to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. Some people insist raw milk is more healthful than commercial milk since it contains active enzymes that help with digestion and absorption of nutrients.
