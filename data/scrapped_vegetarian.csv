Abura-age is widely available in Asian markets, either in cans or fresh in cellophane packages.","aburage, inariage, usu-age, usuage",Glycine max,['deep-fried tofu']

Atsu-age is widely available in Asian markets.","atsuage, nama-age",Glycine max,"['abura-age', 'deep-fried tofu', 'pressed tofu']"

9,cheese substitutes,"Many vegetarians eat cheeses made with milk, though many insist on vegetarian cheeses made without animal rennet. Cheese substitutes, on the other hand, are designed either for people who, because of moral scruples or dietary restrictions, don't wish to consume anything made with milk, or for cost-cutters who want to scrimp on real cheese.There are many brands of cheese substitutes on the market today, and most are made with soybeans, rice, almonds and/or hemp seed. Most are made to taste something like popular milk-based cheeses like Cheddar, Mozzarella, Gouda, American, Provolone, and Jack.Cheese substitutes are blander and more rubbery than real cheeses, but many brands melt fairly well in cooked dishes, especially if grated first. Fake mozzarella comes closest in flavor and texture to the real deal.Fake cheese often contains casein or caseinates, which are derived from milk. These kinds of cheeses won't pass muster with many vegans, but they're a good choice for people trying to restrict their consumption of cholesterol and lactose.Strict vegans should seek out cheeses labeled ""vegan"" or ""dairy-free."" Unfortunately, casein is what makes cheese (real and fake alike) more elastic, so non-dairy cheeses won't pull and stretch properly when melted.","artificial cheese, cheese alternatives, cheese analogues, cheeze, fake cheese, nondairy cheese, phony cheese",,['cheese']

13,coconut milk,"This is available in liquid form (in cans or aseptic containers), frozen, and as a powder. Don't confuse coconut milk with coconut water, which is the liquid found in the center of a fresh coconut, or with the sweetened cream of coconut powder used in mixed drinks. Varieties: Light (or ""lite"") coconut milk has less fat and about a quarter of the calories of the regular version, but doesn't taste nearly as rich. You can reduce the fat (and calories) in a can of regular coconut milk by letting it settle, and then skimming and discarding some of the thick coconut cream off the top. Lighten what's left even more by diluting it with water or chicken broth.

You can also make deep-fried tofu yourself by frying thin slabs of firm tofu in hot oil.","deep-fat fried tofu, fried bean curd",Glycine max,"['abura-age', 'atsu-age', 'seitan']"
17,extra-firm tofu,"This isn't as moist as firm tofu, so it holds its shape better and absorb more flavors.   Store tofu in the refrigerator, changing the water daily, and use it within a week.

Look for cakes of it in plastic tubs in the refrigerated sections of supermarkets and health food stores.",,Glycine max,"['firm tofu', 'pressed tofu', 'atsu-age']"
18,fermented bean curd,"This looks innocent enough, like cubes of tofu immersed in a broth, but it has a very pungent aroma and strong, cheesy flavor.  It comes in two colors.  The white version is often served with rice or used to flavor soups and vegetable dishes, while the red often accompanies meats.  Look for it in jars or crocks in Asian markets.   Store it in the refrigerator after you've opened it, keeping the cubes immersed in liquid or oil to prevent them from drying out and discoloring.","bean cheese, fermented bean cake, foo yi, foo yu, fu yu, preserved bean curd, wet bean curd",Trigonella foenum-graecum,['red bean curd']
19,firm tofu,"Choose this style of tofu if you want to cut it into cubes for stir-frying or crumble it into salads.  Rinse and drain the tofu before you use it.  Tofu will absorb more flavors and hold its shape better if you press out some of the water before marinating or cooking it.  To do so, place the tofu on several layers of paper towels or cheesecloth, cover it with plastic wrap, and put something heavy on it.  Do this for at least an hour, or put the whole assembly in a pan and set it in the refrigerator overnight.  Store tofu in the refrigerator, changing the water daily, and use it within a week.  Freezing firm tofu will make it chewier and give it a meatier texture.

23,miso,"This is a thick paste made from soybeans and grains that has been fermented and then aged for up to three years.   It's a staple in Japan, where it's used to flavor soups, dipping sauces, meats, and dressings.  There are hundreds of varieties of miso, and the Japanese match them to dishes with the same care that Americans match wines to meals.  The darker kinds are saltier and more pungent, the lighter are sweeter and milder.  Always add miso to soups and stews at the end, since boiling it destroys beneficial bacteria and causes it to curdle.  Look for tubs of miso in the refrigerated section of Japanese food markets, health foods stores, or large supermarkets.  It will keep in your  refrigerator for many months.  Powdered miso is also available, as are powdered soup mixes made with miso and dashi.","bean paste, soybean paste",Glycine max,"['soy sauce', 'umeboshi puree']"

41,tempeh,"This Indonesian meat substitute is made from soybeans and other grains that have been injected with a mold and allowed to ferment.   It's rich in protein and fiber and has a chewy texture and salty, nutty flavor.   Before using it, steam or simmer it for about twenty minutes.

There are several varieties of raw tofu, each with different moisture contents.   Silken and soft tofu are relatively moist, and best suited for making shakes, dips, and dressings.  Regular tofu has some of the moisture drained away, and it's best for scrambling or using like cheese in casseroles.  Firm, extra-firm, and pressed tofus are even drier, so they absorb other flavors better and hold their shape in stir-fries and on the grill.  Tofu is also available smoked, pickled, flavored, baked, and deep-fat fried.","bean curd, doufu, soya cheese, soybean curd",Glycine max,"['tempeh', 'seitan', 'textured soy protein', 'chicken']"

49,yuba,"This is the sweet, protein-rich skin that forms on warm soymilk as it cools.  Japanese and Chinese cooks like to add it to soups or use it as wrappers, and when it's deep-fat fried, it makes a fairly realistic ""skin"" for a mock holiday turkey.  You can buy very thin fresh sheets of it (called nama yuba) in Kyoto, Japan, and thicker round sheets that look like fruit leather in some Chinese markets.   Elsewhere, you'll have to get it dried or frozen.   Dried yuba comes as sheets, rolls, knots, and many other forms.  It needs to be reconstituted with water before you can use it, unless you're planning to add it to a soup.","bean curd sheets, bean curd skins, soy milk skins, uba",Glycine max,['bean stick']
