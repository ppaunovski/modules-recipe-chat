163,Chocolate,"Chocolate is made from tropical cacao beans, which are transformed by machines and an inveterate spelling error into a bitter, brown paste of cocoa butter and cocoa solids.  When this unsweetened chocolate is combined with sugar, vanilla, and other ingredients, the result, of course, is heavenly.

Chocolate's notoriously hard to work with.  If you don't store it properly (preferably at 65° or so), the cocoa butter can separate slightly from the solids, causing the chocolate to ""bloom.""  This leaves a telltale gray residue on the surface and impairs the taste and texture slightly.   Chocolate will scorch if you melt it at too high a temperature, or ""seize"" and become thick and grainy if you add even a drop of cold liquid to it as it's melting.  You can prevent it from seizing by adding hot liquids (like cream) to chopped chocolate in order to melt it, or by making sure that anything you're dipping into the melted chocolate (like a strawberry or whisk) is perfectly dry.  If your chocolate has seized, you can still use it in any recipe that calls for chocolate to be blended with a liquid.  Just add the liquid to the chocolate and melt it again.  

If you plan to melt chocolate, it's best to buy it in bars.  Chips contain less cocoa butter so that they can better hold their shape in cookies, but this makes them harder to melt and less tasty.  It's easiest to melt chocolate in a microwave oven.  Just break the chocolate into small pieces, heat it for 30 seconds at 50% power, stir, then repeat a few times.  Take it out of the microwave when the chocolate is almost completely melted, then continue stirring until the melting is complete.  If you don't have a microwave, use a double boiler.",,,"['white chocolate', 'cocoa butter', 'cocoa']"
164,chocolate chips,"These are designed to go into chocolate chip cookies, muffins, and trail mixes.

Gray salt = grey salt = sel gris gets its color from the clay lining the basins.  La fleur de sel (the flower of the salt) is whiter, but has a similar flavor.

That trendy gourmets are willing to shell out $5 for a small packet of French sea salt drives chemists crazy, since almost all of it is just plain salt, sodium chloride, NaCl.   Salt aficionados counter that French sea salt has a much softer and fresher flavor than ordinary table salt, and that the difference is worth it.

These salts comes either coarsely or finely ground.  Since salt is an inorganic mineral, there's no point in grinding large crystals with a salt mill so they'll be ""fresh.""

And Americans have lately taken a fancy to roasting whole bulbs, and then spreading the garlic like a soft cheese on bread or crackers. Garlic's good for you, too. Researchers believe that garlic can bolster the immune system, lower blood pressure and prevent heart disease, and at least some people believe that it can ward off vampires and insects. The only downside is that raw or undercooked garlic tends to linger on the breath, though many people are more than willing to pay that price.

349,kosher salt,"This salt was developed for the preparation of kosher meats, but many cooks prefer it over table salt.  It has coarser grains, so it's easier to use if you, like professional chefs, toss salt into pots with your fingers, measuring by touch.  Most kosher salt is also flaked, giving each grain a larger surface area.  This helps the salt adhere better, so it's great for lining margarita glasses, and for making a salt crust on meats or fish. Kosher salt also is preferred over table salt for canning and pickling.  Like pickling salt, kosher salt is free of iodine, which can react adversely with certain foods.  Some brands of kosher salt contain yellow prussiate of soda, an anti-caking agent, but unlike the anti-caking additive in table salt, it doesn't cloud pickling liquids.  The only drawback to using kosher salt for pickling or canning is that the grains are coarser and flakier, and can't be packed as tightly into a measuring cup as pickling salt.  This raises the risk that the salt won't be properly measured. To get around this problem, measure by weight instead of volume.  With its large grains, kosher salt isn't a good choice for baking.

This concentrates the sugar and allows producers to turn the grapes into sweet, rich dessert wines.  Some of the best late harvest wines are made from grapes that have become moldy with the Botrytis cinerea fungus (also known as ""noble rot"").  The fungus pokes holes in the grape skins, allowing more water to evaporate.  Ice wine = icewine = eiswein is an especially sweet and expensive kind of late harvest wine in which the dehydrated grapes are allowed to freeze on the vine, resulting in a very sweet wine.  These and other late harvest wines are often sold in half-bottles, and are best drunk by themselves or with fruit or light desserts.

It doesn't actually go into the ice cream, as some have learned the hard way, but rather into the wooden ice-filled tub that surrounds the bucket of ice cream.  The salt lowers the freezing point of the ice, which causes it to melt.  As it melts, it absorbs heat from the ice cream, helping it to freeze more quickly.  Use a ratio of one part rock salt for every five parts of ice.  If you're out of rock salt, other kinds of salt will also work, though you should use less since finer grains of salt can can be packed more densely into a cup than large chunks of rock salt.  The biggest danger is that you'll use too much salt, which will make your ice cream freeze too fast and become crusty.  When using salt other than rock salt, start with a modest amount and check the ice cream after you've churned it for ten minutes.  If the ice cream is just beginning to firm up, you have the right amount of salt.  If it's not yet firming up, you need to add more salt.   If it's crusty along the sides of the bucket, then you've added too much salt.","halite, ice cream salt, land salt, sidewalk salt",,"['kosher salt', 'table salt']"

You can buy saffron either as as unprocessed stigmas (called saffron threads) or powdered. The threads should be red with orange tips. Threads lacking orange tips may be dyed, so avoid them. The quality of powdered saffron is measured by its Minimum Coloring Strength. The higher the Minimum Coloring Strength, the less saffron you need to use. A typical level is 180, and a level of 220 or higher is quite good. Some cooks prefer the threads to the powder, since it's hard to detect if the powder has been adulterated. Powdered saffron, though, is easier to use, since it can be added directly to a dish, while the threads need to be steeped in hot water first.",,Crocus sativus,"['turmeric', 'safflower', 'marigold blossom', 'water', 'food coloring']"

Salt connoisseurs, though, often prefer to use Kosher salt for cooking, and sea salt for table use.  They claim that both have a softer flavor than table salt.   Exotic salts include the expensive French and Hawaiian sea salts, the smoky, sulfuric Indian black salt, and the intensely salty Korean bamboo salt. Specialized salts include pickling salt, which is free of the additives that turn pickles dark and the pickling liquid cloudy, and rock salt, used primarily to de-ice driveways and make ice cream.
Tips: Adding salt to water will raise the temperature at which it boils and lower the temperature at which it freezes.
Though we need some salt in our diet, most Americans consume much more than necessary.  Too much salt can lead to high blood pressure.
Salt is a terrific flavor enhancer, helping to reduce bitterness and acidity, and bringing out other flavors in the food. 
Adding salt to bread dough controls the action of the yeast and improves the flavor.  Bread made without salt will have a coarser texture and a blander flavor than bread made with salt.  
Try sprinkling salt on citrus fruit, melons, tomatoes, and even wine to enhance flavor.
Adding a little salt balances the flavor of sweets like cakes, cookies, and candies.
Boiling eggs in salted water makes them easier to peel.
Adding a pinch of salt (preferably non-iodized) to cream or egg whites before they're whipped increases their volume and serves as a stabilizer.  
Salt is a mineral, so it can be stored indefinitely without going stale.  It won't taste any fresher if you grind it with a salt mill.
Salt has been used for millennia as a preservative for meats, fish, cheese, and other foods.  It works by absorbing moisture from the cells of bacteria and mold through osmosis, which kills them or leaves them unable to reproduce.

For example, iodine darkens pickles and inhibits the bacterial fermentation  needed to make sauerkraut.   Table salt also contains small amounts of calcium silicate, an anti-caking agent, and dextrose, a stabilizer.  The anti-caking agent in both iodized and non-iodized salt doesn't dissolve in water, so if you pickle or can with it, it will turn the liquid cloudy or else settle on the bottom of the jar.  The preserved food will taste the same, mind you, but it won't look as appealing.  This is more of a problem for pickles, which are immersed in lots of liquid, than for other canned goods.

696,white chocolate,"Like milk chocolate, this is made of cocoa butter, sugar, milk, and vanilla.  The only difference is that white chocolate doesn't have any cocoa solids.  Since the FDA won't let American producers label a product  ""chocolate"" unless it has those cocoa solids, domestic white chocolate is known by a hodge-podge of different names.  White chocolate scorches easily, so cook it gently.   Bars and wafers usually taste better than chips.  Avoid white chocolate that's made with vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter--it's cheaper but not nearly as good.","cholocate, white, white baking bar",,['milk chocolate']

The syrup can be used in sauces or other dishes that call for wine.","wine extract, wine syrup",,['wine']
709,wine vinegar,"Wine vinegars are milder and less acidic than cider or white distilled vinegar, so they're a good choice for salad dressings, sauces, and marinades. There are several varieties, ranging from mild champagne vinegar to the tangy white and red wine vinegars to the dark and assertive balsamic and sherry vinegars. The milder vinegars go best with more delicate dishes, like salads, which stronger ones are best for deglazing pans, marinating meats, and adding tang to sauces.
