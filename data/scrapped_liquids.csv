Light whipping cream = whipping cream (with a butterfat content of 30 - 36%) and heavy cream = heavy whipping cream (with at least 36% fat) are heavy enough to whip, and aren't as prone as lower-fat creams to curdling in sauces. The higher the butterfat content, the less beating is required to get whipped cream.  Europeans go for even heavier creams, like double cream (with a butterfat content of 42%), extra-thick double cream, and clotted cream = Devonshire cream, which is often spread like butter over scones. Look for clotted cream in large supermarkets, but (perhaps luckily) the double creams are very hard to find.

Sulfured molasses has sulfur dioxide added as a preservative. Light molasses = mild molasses = sweet molasses = Barbados molasses is taken from the first boiling. It's the sweetest and mildest, and is often used as a pancake syrup or a sweetener for beverages. Dark molasses = full molasses = full-flavored molasses is left behind after the juices are boiled a second time. It's less sweet but more flavorful than light molasses, and it's a good choice if a recipe simply calls for molasses. Sugar-beet molasses is very bitter and is mostly used as cattle feed or as a medium for growing yeast. When measuring molasses, grease the cup and utensils to keep molasses from sticking. If your molasses crystallizes while being stored, heat it gently to dissolve the crystals. After opening, you can store molasses in your cupboard.","Barbados molasses, Dark molasses, full molasses, full-flavored molasses, Light molasses, mild molasses, sweet molasses",,"['dark corn syrup', 'maple syrup', 'honey', 'barley malt syrup', 'dark brown sugar', 'golden syrup']"

Some people insist raw milk is more healthful than commercial milk since it contains active enzymes that help with digestion and absorption of nutrients.

Examples of fino include the exquisite Manzanilla and the potent and nutty Amontillado.  Oloroso sherry is more heavily fortified than fino.  Examples include Amoroso and cream sherry, both of which are sweetened and especially popular in Britain.  Once bottled, sherry doesn't age well, so you should plan to use it no more than a year or two after you buy it.   Once opened, fino sherries should be consumed within a few days and stored in the refrigerator.  Oloroso sherries can be stored a bit longer, say a week.

A red wine should be served at room temperature, and it goes well with hearty, meat-based dishes like steak and spaghetti.  White and blush wines should be served chilled, and they go best with lighter fare, like fish and chicken.  Many wines, called varietals, are named after the variety of grape used to make them.  Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, and Pinot Noir are popular red varietals, while Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, and Johannisberg Riesling are popular white ones.  In Europe, some wines, often blends of different varietals, are named after the place where the wine is produced, like Bordeaux, Burgundy, Chablis, Rhine, and Rhône.  These European wines are often superb, but American wines that have borrowed these regional names, like California Chablis, are almost always mediocre.
