0,abura-age,"These are thin slices of tofu that have been deep-fat fried.  They can be cut open and filled with rice to make inari sushi, or used as a meat substitute in soups.

1,acorn,"These nuts come from oak trees, and they were once an important food for Native Americans.   Before they can be eaten, most acorns need to be treated to remove the bitter tannins in them.   To do this, boil whole shelled acorns in water, replacing the water with fresh boiling water whenever it turns light brown. Keep doing this for about two hours, until the water no longer changes color.   Alternatively, you can soak the shelled acorns in several changes of water for three or four days.  Some Native Americans do this by putting whole or pounded acorns into nylon stockings and hanging them so that they're immersed in the water of a toilet tank (repeat:  tank, not bowl).  Each time the toilet is flushed, the water in the tank is refreshed.  This may discolor the toilet, however.  After the nuts have been leached of tannins, roast them in a 350° oven for about an hour.  They can then be eaten whole or ground into acorn meal and used to make porridges or breads.  Acorns from white oaks aren't nearly as bitter as those from red or black oaks, and can be roasted without first soaking them.",oaknut,Quercus,"['hazelnut', 'chestnut']"

They appear fresh in the fall and winter, but you can find them dried, vacuum-packed, or canned throughout the year. Before you can eat them, fresh chestnuts need to be boiled or roasted, and then shelled and peeled. To roast them, cut an X into each shell (to allow steam to escape) and bake them in a 400° oven for about twenty minutes. While they're still warm, peel off both the shell and the furry skin surrounding each nut. Alternatively, boil the chestnuts for about 15 minutes, then remove them from the water with a slotted spoon. Peel off the shells and put the nuts back in the boiling water for another minute, then remove them again and peel off the skins. Select fresh chestnuts that are shiny and heavy for their size.

There are ways to enjoy beans without having to forego social appointments, however.  One is to change the water from time to time while you're soaking or cooking the beans.   Pouring off the water helps gets rid of the indigestible complex sugars that create gas in your intestine.  It also helps to cook the beans thoroughly, until they can be easily mashed with a fork.

Tofu will absorb more flavors and hold its shape better if you press out some of the water before marinating or cooking it.  To do so, place the tofu on several layers of paper towels or cheesecloth, cover it with plastic wrap, and put something heavy on it.  Do this for at least an hour, or put the whole assembly in a pan and set it in the refrigerator overnight.  Store tofu in the refrigerator, changing the water daily, and use it within a week.

Lentils have a mild, often earthy flavor, and they're best if cooked with assertive flavorings.  The best, most delicate lentils are the peppery French green lentils. These hold their shape well, but take longer to cook than other lentils. The milder brown lentils also hold their shape after cooking, but can easily turn mushy if overcooked.  Indian markets also carry a wide variety of split lentils, called dal.   Before cooking, always rinse lentils and pick out stones and other debris.  Unlike dried beans and peas, there's no need to soak them.  Lentils cook more slowly if they're combined with salt or acidic ingredients, so add these last.  Bigger or older lentils take longer to cook.  Store dried lentils for up to a year in a cool, dry place.",,Lens culinaris,"['dal', 'green pea', 'black-eyed pea']"

Shelled frozen limas are a good substitute for fresh, but canned limas aren't nearly as good.

The darker kinds are saltier and more pungent, the lighter are sweeter and milder.  Always add miso to soups and stews at the end, since boiling it destroys beneficial bacteria and causes it to curdle.

You can also use a food processor fitted with a steel blade to do this, but it's hard to keep the nut meal from turning into nut butter.

Nuts are usually high in fat and protein, and people throughout the world eat them as snacks or incorporate them into both sweet and savory dishes.  Many nuts can be eaten raw but roasting them helps intensify their flavor.   Nuts are usually harvested in the fall, and it's best to buy unprocessed nuts then.

To roast, put shelled walnuts on a baking pan and in bake them in a 325° oven, stirring occasionally, until they're slightly golden, about ten minutes.    After you remove the nuts from the oven, rub them vigorously with a towel so as to remove as much of their bitter skins as possible.  Fresh walnuts are available year-round, but they're best in the fall.  Since they're high in fat and therefore prone to rancidity, it's best to store them in the refrigerator or freezer.","English walnuts, Persian walnuts, royal walnuts",Juglans regia,"['butternut', 'pecan', 'hazelnut', 'pine nut']"

191,water caltrop,"This black nut bears an unmistakable resemblance to a bull's head. Each one is about two inches across, and has a very hard shell. After you shell water caltrops, you'll need to steam or boil them before you can eat them as they contain harmful toxins in their raw state. Or you can skip eating them altogether, and just use them to make jewelry.","horned water chestnut, Jesuit nut, ling chio, ling jiao, ling kio, ling kok",Trapa bicornis,['water chestnut']

You can also boil or steam them like green beans, though they're not as sweet and juicy.  They don't store well, so use them within a few days of purchase.","asparagus bean, bodi, boonchi, Chinese long bean, dau gok, dow gok, long bean, long-podded cowpea, snake bean",Vigna unguiculata subsp.

201,yuba,"This is the sweet, protein-rich skin that forms on warm soymilk as it cools.  Japanese and Chinese cooks like to add it to soups or use it as wrappers, and when it's deep-fat fried, it makes a fairly realistic ""skin"" for a mock holiday turkey.  You can buy very thin fresh sheets of it (called nama yuba) in Kyoto, Japan, and thicker round sheets that look like fruit leather in some Chinese markets.   Elsewhere, you'll have to get it dried or frozen.   Dried yuba comes as sheets, rolls, knots, and many other forms.  It needs to be reconstituted with water before you can use it, unless you're planning to add it to a soup.","bean curd sheets, bean curd skins, soy milk skins, uba",Glycine max,['bean stick']
