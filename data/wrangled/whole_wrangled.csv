Chocolate,"Chocolate is made from tropical cacao beans, which are transformed by machines and an inveterate spelling error into a bitter, brown paste of cocoa butter and cocoa solids.  When this unsweetened chocolate is combined with sugar, vanilla, and other ingredients, the result, of course, is heavenly.

Chocolate's notoriously hard to work with.  If you don't store it properly (preferably at 65° or so), the cocoa butter can separate slightly from the solids, causing the chocolate to ""bloom.""  This leaves a telltale gray residue on the surface and impairs the taste and texture slightly.   Chocolate will scorch if you melt it at too high a temperature, or ""seize"" and become thick and grainy if you add even a drop of cold liquid to it as it's melting.  You can prevent it from seizing by adding hot liquids (like cream) to chopped chocolate in order to melt it, or by making sure that anything you're dipping into the melted chocolate (like a strawberry or whisk) is perfectly dry.  If your chocolate has seized, you can still use it in any recipe that calls for chocolate to be blended with a liquid.  Just add the liquid to the chocolate and melt it again.  

If you plan to melt chocolate, it's best to buy it in bars.  Chips contain less cocoa butter so that they can better hold their shape in cookies, but this makes them harder to melt and less tasty.  It's easiest to melt chocolate in a microwave oven.  Just break the chocolate into small pieces, heat it for 30 seconds at 50% power, stir, then repeat a few times.  Take it out of the microwave when the chocolate is almost completely melted, then continue stirring until the melting is complete.  If you don't have a microwave, use a double boiler.",,,"white chocolate,cocoa butter,cocoa",flavorings

And Americans have lately taken a fancy to roasting whole bulbs, and then spreading the garlic like a soft cheese on bread or crackers. Garlic's good for you, too. Researchers believe that garlic can bolster the immune system, lower blood pressure and prevent heart disease, and at least some people believe that it can ward off vampires and insects. The only downside is that raw or undercooked garlic tends to linger on the breath, though many people are more than willing to pay that price.

honey,"This is a thick liquid sweetener that's produced by bees from the nectar of flowers.

As a rule of thumb, the lighter the color of the honey, the milder the flavor.You shouldn't feed honey to babies younger than one year--it could cause infant botulism. Store honey in a cool, dark place, where it will keep almost indefinitely. If the honey crystallizes, heat it briefly in a pan of hot water or in the microwave.Because the production of honey exploits bees, many vegetarians and vegans refuse to eat it.Popular varieties:Alfalfa honey is a very popular light and mild honey, great for baking or table use.Basswood honey is light in color, but it has a fairly strong flavor.Buckwheat honey is very dark and bold-flavored, so it's not well suited to baking.Clover honey is America's most popular honey, very mild and fine-flavored.Eucalyptus honey, popular in Australia, has a somewhat bold and slightly medicinal flavor.Orange blossom honey is an excellent, mild honey with a delicate flowery flavor.Sage honey is almost white in color, with a mild flavor.Tulip poplar honey is dark, yet mild-tasting.Tupelo honey is highly prized for its distinctive mild flavor; it's also relatively expensive.Wildflower honey has a fairly strong flavor.","Alfalfa honey, Basswood honey, Buckwheat honey, Clover honey, Eucalyptus honey, Orange blossom honey, Sage honey, Tulip poplar honey, Tupelo honey, Wildflower honey",,liquid honey,flavorings

kosher salt,"This salt was developed for the preparation of kosher meats, but many cooks prefer it over table salt.  It has coarser grains, so it's easier to use if you, like professional chefs, toss salt into pots with your fingers, measuring by touch.  Most kosher salt is also flaked, giving each grain a larger surface area.  This helps the salt adhere better, so it's great for lining margarita glasses, and for making a salt crust on meats or fish. Kosher salt also is preferred over table salt for canning and pickling.  Like pickling salt, kosher salt is free of iodine, which can react adversely with certain foods.  Some brands of kosher salt contain yellow prussiate of soda, an anti-caking agent, but unlike the anti-caking additive in table salt, it doesn't cloud pickling liquids.  The only drawback to using kosher salt for pickling or canning is that the grains are coarser and flakier, and can't be packed as tightly into a measuring cup as pickling salt.  This raises the risk that the salt won't be properly measured. To get around this problem, measure by weight instead of volume.  With its large grains, kosher salt isn't a good choice for baking.  Look for boxes of it in the spice section of your supermarket.",,,"pickling salt,Margarita salt,table salt",flavorings

late harvest wine,"These pricey wines are produced from grapes that are picked late in the season, after they've shriveled a bit on the vine.  This concentrates the sugar and allows producers to turn the grapes into sweet, rich dessert wines.  Some of the best late harvest wines are made from grapes that have become moldy with the Botrytis cinerea fungus (also known as ""noble rot"").  The fungus pokes holes in the grape skins, allowing more water to evaporate.  Ice wine = icewine = eiswein is an especially sweet and expensive kind of late harvest wine in which the dehydrated grapes are allowed to freeze on the vine, resulting in a very sweet wine.

There are several different varieties: Unsulfured molasses is what you'll most often find in supermarkets. It's milder and sweeter than sulfured molasses. Sulfured molasses has sulfur dioxide added as a preservative. Light molasses = mild molasses = sweet molasses = Barbados molasses is taken from the first boiling. It's the sweetest and mildest, and is often used as a pancake syrup or a sweetener for beverages. Dark molasses = full molasses = full-flavored molasses is left behind after the juices are boiled a second time. It's less sweet but more flavorful than light molasses, and it's a good choice if a recipe simply calls for molasses. Sugar-beet molasses is very bitter and is mostly used as cattle feed or as a medium for growing yeast. When measuring molasses, grease the cup and utensils to keep molasses from sticking. If your molasses crystallizes while being stored, heat it gently to dissolve the crystals.

rock salt,"This is the cheap, non-food grade salt that we throw onto icy walkways and use to make ice cream.  It doesn't actually go into the ice cream, as some have learned the hard way, but rather into the wooden ice-filled tub that surrounds the bucket of ice cream.  The salt lowers the freezing point of the ice, which causes it to melt.  As it melts, it absorbs heat from the ice cream, helping it to freeze more quickly.  Use a ratio of one part rock salt for every five parts of ice.  If you're out of rock salt, other kinds of salt will also work, though you should use less since finer grains of salt can can be packed more densely into a cup than large chunks of rock salt.  The biggest danger is that you'll use too much salt, which will make your ice cream freeze too fast and become crusty.  When using salt other than rock salt, start with a modest amount and check the ice cream after you've churned it for ten minutes.  If the ice cream is just beginning to firm up, you have the right amount of salt.  If it's not yet firming up, you need to add more salt.   If it's crusty along the sides of the bucket, then you've added too much salt.","halite, ice cream salt, land salt, sidewalk salt",,"kosher salt,table salt",flavorings

saffron,"To make a pound of saffron, over two hundred thousand stigmas from crocus sativus flowers must be harvested by hand. That's why saffron is the world's most expensive spice, and also why so there are so many fakes on the market. Fortunately, a little of the good stuff goes a long way--it only takes a few threads to add saffron's distinct yellow color and earthy aroma to a family meal of paella or bouillabaisse. You can buy saffron either as as unprocessed stigmas (called saffron threads) or powdered. The threads should be red with orange tips. Threads lacking orange tips may be dyed, so avoid them. The quality of powdered saffron is measured by its Minimum Coloring Strength. The higher the Minimum Coloring Strength, the less saffron you need to use. A typical level is 180, and a level of 220 or higher is quite good. Some cooks prefer the threads to the powder, since it's hard to detect if the powder has been adulterated. Powdered saffron, though, is easier to use, since it can be added directly to a dish, while the threads need to be steeped in hot water first.",,Crocus sativus,"turmeric,safflower,marigold blossom,water,food coloring",flavorings

Salt,"Most recipes that call for salt are referring to table salt, which has additives like iodine (to prevent a thyroid disease), and an anti-caking agent so the salt won't get lumpy in humid weather.  Salt connoisseurs, though, often prefer to use Kosher salt for cooking, and sea salt for table use.  They claim that both have a softer flavor than table salt.   Exotic salts include the expensive French and Hawaiian sea salts, the smoky, sulfuric Indian black salt, and the intensely salty Korean bamboo salt. Specialized salts include pickling salt, which is free of the additives that turn pickles dark and the pickling liquid cloudy, and rock salt, used primarily to de-ice driveways and make ice cream.
Tips: Adding salt to water will raise the temperature at which it boils and lower the temperature at which it freezes.
Though we need some salt in our diet, most Americans consume much more than necessary.  Too much salt can lead to high blood pressure.
Salt is a terrific flavor enhancer, helping to reduce bitterness and acidity, and bringing out other flavors in the food. 
Adding salt to bread dough controls the action of the yeast and improves the flavor.  Bread made without salt will have a coarser texture and a blander flavor than bread made with salt.  
Try sprinkling salt on citrus fruit, melons, tomatoes, and even wine to enhance flavor.
Adding a little salt balances the flavor of sweets like cakes, cookies, and candies.
Boiling eggs in salted water makes them easier to peel.
Adding a pinch of salt (preferably non-iodized) to cream or egg whites before they're whipped increases their volume and serves as a stabilizer.  
Salt is a mineral, so it can be stored indefinitely without going stale.  It won't taste any fresher if you grind it with a salt mill.
Salt has been used for millennia as a preservative for meats, fish, cheese, and other foods.  It works by absorbing moisture from the cells of bacteria and mold through osmosis, which kills them or leaves them unable to reproduce.
Salting slices of eggplants helps draw out the bitter juices.

Other commercial salt substitutes, like No Salt®, Salt Substitute®, Cardia®, and Lite Salt®, replace some or all of the sodium chloride (ordinary salt) with potassium chloride, which has a slightly bitter taste.  These substitutes are sometimes recommended for people on sodium-restricted diets.  It's recommended that you consult a physician before using these products, especially if you have diabetes or kidney disease, or if you're taking diuretics or potassium supplements, or if you're on a potassium restricted diet.

Examples include Amoroso and cream sherry, both of which are sweetened and especially popular in Britain.  Once bottled, sherry doesn't age well, so you should plan to use it no more than a year or two after you buy it.

table salt,"Varieties include iodized salt, which contains the flavorless additive potassium iodide to prevent goiter (an enlargement of the thyroid gland), and non-iodized salt.  Some recipes call for non-iodized salt, since iodine can impart a bitter taste and adversely react with certain foods.  For example, iodine darkens pickles and inhibits the bacterial fermentation  needed to make sauerkraut.   Table salt also contains small amounts of calcium silicate, an anti-caking agent, and dextrose, a stabilizer.  The anti-caking agent in both iodized and non-iodized salt doesn't dissolve in water, so if you pickle or can with it, it will turn the liquid cloudy or else settle on the bottom of the jar.  The preserved food will taste the same, mind you, but it won't look as appealing.  This is more of a problem for pickles, which are immersed in lots of liquid, than for other canned goods. To prevent the cloudiness, use pickling salt, which contains no additives.","cooking salt, granular salt",,"kosher salt,sea salt",flavorings

Olives,"A staple of Mediterranean cuisines, olives are most often eaten out of hand, though cooks also use them to flavor everything from pizzas to martinis.  Raw olives must be cured before they can be eaten, and the curing medium--usually lye, brine, or salt--affects their flavor and texture.  So too does the olive's degree of ripeness when it's picked.  Green olives are picked while unripe, which makes them denser and more bitter than brown or black olives, which stay on the tree until fully ripened.   Olives become bitter if they're cooked too long, so always add them to hot dishes at the last minute.

Look for it in the dairy case--it's usually sold in strips of three packages or in 4-ounce jars.  Always check the expiration date to make sure it's fresh.  Dry yeast can be stored at room temperature until the expiration date--or within 4 months of opening--but it lasts even longer in the refrigerator or freezer.  Always bring yeast to room temperature before you use it.   It's important to keep stored yeast away from air and moisture, so use the smallest container you can find and seal it well.",,,"fresh yeast,instant yeast,bread machine yeast",baking-supplies
baker's ammonia,"Originally made from the ground antlers of reindeer, this is an ancestor of modern baking powder.  Northern Europeans still use it because it makes their springerle and gingerbread cookies very light and crisp.  Unfortunately, it can impart an unpleasant ammonia flavor, so it's best used in cookies and pastries that are small enough to allow the ammonia odor to dissipate while baking.  
Look for it in German or Scandinavian markets, drug stores, baking supply stores, or a mail order catalogue.  Don't confuse this with ordinary household ammonia, which is poisonous.  Varieties:  It comes either as lumps or powder.  If it isn't powdered, crush it into a very fine powder with a mortar and pestle or a rolling pin.","ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium carbonate, baking ammonia, bicarbonate of ammonia, carbonate of ammonia, hartshorn, hartzhorn, hirschhornsalz, hjorthornssalt, powdered baking ammonia, salt of hartshorn, triebsalz",,"baking powder,baking soda",baking-supplies
baker's yeast,"This is used as a leaven in breads, coffeecakes, and pastries like croissants and brioche.  It works by converting sugar into carbon dioxide, which causes the dough to rise so the bread will be light and airy.  Yeast comes either as dry granules or moist cakes.   It becomes less potent after the expiration date stamped on the package, so dough made with it may take longer to rise, or not rise at all.  If the potency of the yeast is in doubt, test or ""proof"" it by putting some of it in warm water (105° - 115° F) mixed with a bit of sugar.  If it doesn't get foamy within ten minutes, you'll need to get fresher yeast.","baking yeast, bread yeast",,,baking-supplies
baking powder,"Baking powder is a mixture of one or more acidic salts and baking soda, an alkali.  These two compounds react when they get wet and release carbon dioxide gas bubbles. These, in turn, cause baked goods to rise.  Baking powder is perishable. To test a batch, add 1 teaspoon to ½ cup hot water. If it doesn't bubble, throw it out.  Look for baking powder among the baking supplies in most supermarkets.
Most recipes that call for baking powder intend for you to use double-acting baking powder.  This includes two acidic salts--one that reacts when wet and one that reacts heated.  By giving the baking soda two chances to react, it usually results in light and airy baked goods.  Less common is single-acting baking powder, which only reacts when it becomes wet. When using this kind of baking powder, you have to get the batter into a preheated oven immediately after you mix the wet and dry ingredients together.  Aluminum-free baking powder is preferred by many cooks; powders made with aluminum lend an unpleasant flavor to delicately-flavored baked goods","double-acting baking powder, single-acting baking powder",,"cream of tartar,cream of tartar,buttermilk,molasses",baking-supplies
baking soda,"Baking soda is alkaline, and when mixed with acidic ingredients, it reacts and releases bubbles of carbon dioxide.  These bubbles, when trapped inside batter, help baked goods rise.  Baking powder contains baking soda, along with acidic salts that react with the soda when they get wet or heated.   Recipes that call for both baking powder and baking soda are probably using the baking soda to offset extra acidity in the batter (from ingredients like buttermilk or molasses) and to weaken the proteins in the flour.  Omitting the baking soda from these recipes may alter the color or flavor of whatever you're baking, and make it less tender.
Tips: Baking soda is used in devil's food cake because it turns the cocoa powder reddish brown.  
Vegetables cooked in water mixed with baking soda don't lose as much color, though the baking soda makes them mushier and causes them to lose vitamin C.  
Sprinkling baking soda on a grease or electrical fire will help extinguish it.
Placing an opened box in the refrigerator or freezer will absorb bad odors 
Baking soda is a good, mildly abrasive scouring powder.

That type of yeast is deactivated, so it won't produce any alcohol or bubbles.",,,,baking-supplies
bread machine yeast,"This type of dry yeast is highly active and very finely granulated so that it hydrates quickly.  Breads made with this yeast require only a single rise, so this yeast is handy to use in a bread machine.  Most machines will have you add this yeast last, on top of the dry ingredients.  If you're not using a bread machine, add this yeast to the flour and other dry ingredients.   It's often sold in 4-ounce jars.  You can store unopened jars at room temperature until the expiration date stamped on the jar, but the yeast lasts even longer in the refrigerator or freezer.  If you freeze yeast, let it come to room temperature before using.",,,"instant yeast,active dry yeast,fresh yeast",baking-supplies
brewer's yeast,"This inactive yeast is rich in protein and B vitamins, and it's used a nutritional supplement.  It's a by-product of beer-making, which gives it a slightly bitter flavor.  If you object to the bitterness, try nutritional yeast, which is made from the same yeast strain but grown on molasses.  It's more expensive but has a more pleasant flavor.  You can also buy debittered brewer's yeast.  Brewer's yeast comes powdered (the most potent form), in flakes (best for health shakes), and in tablets.  Don't confuse this with active forms of yeast, like the kinds bakers, brewers, and winemakers use.

fresh yeast,"This form of yeast usually comes in 0.6-ounce or 2-ounce foil-wrapped cakes.   It works faster and longer than active dry yeast, but it's very perishable and loses potency a few weeks after it's packed.  It's popular among commercial bakers, who can keep ahead of the expiration dates, but home bakers usually prefer dry yeast.  To use, soften the cake in a liquid that's 70° - 80° F.  Store fresh yeast in the refrigerator, well wrapped, or in the freezer, where it will keep for up to four months.

The trade-off is that some flavor is sacrificed, though this doesn't matter much if the bread is sweetened or heavily flavored with other ingredients.  Unlike ordinary active dry yeast, instant yeast doesn't need to be dissolved in liquid first--you just add it to the dry ingredients.  Look for it in the dairy case--it's usually sold in strips of three packages or in 4-ounce jars.   Before buying it, check the expiration date to make sure it's fresh.

Nutritional yeast is very similar to brewer's yeast, which is also used as a nutritional supplement and is made from the same strain of yeast.  The difference is that brewer's yeast is a by-product of beer production and retains some of the bitter flavor of hops.   Don't confuse nutritional yeast, which is deactivated, with active forms of yeast, like the kinds bakers, brewers, and winemakers use.

yeast,"Yeast is a one-celled fungus that converts sugar and starch into carbon dioxide bubbles and alcohol.   This has made it a useful ally in the production of bread, beer, and wine.   There are many varieties of yeast.  Bread is made with baker's yeast, which creates lots of bubbles that become trapped in the dough, making the bread rise so it's light and airy when baked.  A small amount of alcohol is also produced, but this burns off as the bread bakes.   Beer yeast and wine yeast are used to convert sugar into alcohol and, in the case of beer and champagne, bubbles.  You should never eat raw active yeast, since it will continue to grow in your intestine and rob your body of valuable nutrients.  But once deactivated through pasteurization, yeast is a good source of nutrients.  Brewer's yeast and nutritional yeast, for example, are sold as nutritional supplements, and Australians are fond of yeast extracts--like Vegemite, Marmite, and Promite--which they spread like peanut butter on bread.",,,,baking-supplies

yeast starter,"A starter is a mixture of flour, water, and other ingredients that's been colonized by wild airborne yeast and friendly bacteria.  These one-celled immigrants lend the starter--and the breads made with it--a special character.  Sourdough starter, for example, contains a strain of yeast that's tolerant of the lactic and acetic acids produced by the lactobacilli.  Those acids give sourdough bread its characteristic tang.  The French use a soupy starter called a poolish to make their breads, while the Italians use a thicker one called a biga.  Up until the late 19th century, all yeast breads were leavened with starters, and keeping a starter alive in its crock was a routine household chore.  To keep your own starter alive, wait until it's established, then store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.  To keep it healthy, bring it to room temperature once a week and remove all but about 25% of it (either make bread with it or discard it).  Replace what you've taken with a mixture of equal parts warm water and flour, stir, then return it to the refrigerator.  Properly maintained, a starter can last for decades, developing an ever more distinctive character as it ages.   To use a starter to make bread, remove some of it (usually about 2 cups), and use it in place of other forms of yeast.  Replace the amount you took with a mixture of equal parts flour and warm water.  Discard your starter if it becomes orange or pink, or if it develops an unpleasant odor.   It's easy to make starters from scratch, but even easier to borrow some from a friend.  Since sourdough starters must be colonized by strains of yeast and lactobacilli that are particular to certain regions (like San Francisco), a homemade starter might not yield sour bread.   Your best bet is to get a powdered sourdough starter mix from your supermarket or a mail order supplier.","biga, poolish, Sourdough starter",,flour,baking-supplies

It can't be whipped, but it's nice with coffee, or on cereal.  Light cream = coffee cream = table cream is richer at 18 - 30% fat, but it still can't be whipped.  Light whipping cream = whipping cream (with a butterfat content of 30 - 36%) and heavy cream = heavy whipping cream (with at least 36% fat) are heavy enough to whip, and aren't as prone as lower-fat creams to curdling in sauces. The higher the butterfat content, the less beating is required to get whipped cream.  Europeans go for even heavier creams, like double cream (with a butterfat content of 42%), extra-thick double cream, and clotted cream = Devonshire cream, which is often spread like butter over scones. Look for clotted cream in large supermarkets, but (perhaps luckily) the double creams are very hard to find. You can buy ultra-pasteurized versions of these creams, but they tend to have a burnt milk taste and don't whip as well.",,Bos taurus,"evaporated milk,yogurt",dairy
cream cheese,"An American favorite, cream cheese is a terrific spread for bagels and nut breads and a key ingredient in cheesecake and other desserts.  It comes in low-fat and nonfat versions; these work well as spreads but compromise the flavor and texture of cheesecakes.  Cream cheese made without stabilizers is also disappointing in cheesecakes, though it makes for a more acidic and flavorful spread.  Store in the refrigerator.

Egg yolks make wonderful thickeners--imparting both a rich flavor and velvety smooth texture--but they're tricky to use.  You can't just whisk them into a simmering sauce--they'd curdle on contact.  Instead, you need to ""temper"" them by adding some of the hot liquid to the egg yolks, whisking the mixture together, and then adding it to the sauce.  To prevent the yolks from coagulating, you need to keep the sauce below 190°, although this rule can be broken if the sauce has a lot of flour in it.

raw milk,"A few decades ago, the cream in milk would rise to the top and a glass of milk sitting on the counter would gradually turn sour. No more. Most commercial milk today is homogenized so that the fat is broken into small particles which remain suspended in the milk, and pasteurized to kill bacteria, including the friendly varieties that gave milk a sour tang. Raw milk isn't pasteurized; producers instead keep their cows and dairies clean in order to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. Some people insist raw milk is more healthful than commercial milk since it contains active enzymes that help with digestion and absorption of nutrients. Many cheesemakers prefer it since pasteurization diminishes the cheese's flavor potential and homogenization gives it a waxy texture.

Cheese substitutes, on the other hand, are designed either for people who, because of moral scruples or dietary restrictions, don't wish to consume anything made with milk, or for cost-cutters who want to scrimp on real cheese.There are many brands of cheese substitutes on the market today, and most are made with soybeans, rice, almonds and/or hemp seed. Most are made to taste something like popular milk-based cheeses like Cheddar, Mozzarella, Gouda, American, Provolone, and Jack.Cheese substitutes are blander and more rubbery than real cheeses, but many brands melt fairly well in cooked dishes, especially if grated first. Fake mozzarella comes closest in flavor and texture to the real deal.Fake cheese often contains casein or caseinates, which are derived from milk. These kinds of cheeses won't pass muster with many vegans, but they're a good choice for people trying to restrict their consumption of cholesterol and lactose.Strict vegans should seek out cheeses labeled ""vegan"" or ""dairy-free."" Unfortunately, casein is what makes cheese (real and fake alike) more elastic, so non-dairy cheeses won't pull and stretch properly when melted.","artificial cheese, cheese alternatives, cheese analogues, cheeze, fake cheese, nondairy cheese, phony cheese",,cheese,vegetarian

Olives,"A staple of Mediterranean cuisines, olives are most often eaten out of hand, though cooks also use them to flavor everything from pizzas to martinis.  Raw olives must be cured before they can be eaten, and the curing medium--usually lye, brine, or salt--affects their flavor and texture.  So too does the olive's degree of ripeness when it's picked.  Green olives are picked while unripe, which makes them denser and more bitter than brown or black olives, which stay on the tree until fully ripened.   Olives become bitter if they're cooked too long, so always add them to hot dishes at the last minute.

arrowroot starch,"This starch thickener has several advantages over cornstarch. It has a more neutral flavor, so it's a good thickener for delicately flavored sauces. It also works at a lower temperature, and tolerates acidic ingredients and prolonged cooking better. And while sauces thickened with cornstarch turn into a spongy mess if they're frozen, those made with arrowroot can be frozen and thawed with impunity. The downside is that arrowroot is pricier than cornstarch, and it's not a good thickener for dairy-based sauces, since it turns them slimy. 
Arrowroot also imparts a shiny gloss to foods, and while it can make a dessert sauce glow spectacularly, it can make a meat sauce look eerie and fake. To thicken with arrowroot, mix it with an equal amount of cold water, then whisk the slurry into a hot liquid for about 30 seconds. Look for it in Asian markets and health food stores. Equivalents: One tablespoon thickens one cup of liquid. Substitutes: tapioca starch (very similar) OR Instant ClearJel® OR cornstarch (Cornstarch doesn't impart as glossy a finish and can leave a starchy taste if undercooked.) OR kudzu powder OR potato starch OR rice starch OR flour (Flour makes an opaque sauce, imparts a floury taste, and can easily turn lumpy.

baker's ammonia,"Originally made from the ground antlers of reindeer, this is an ancestor of modern baking powder.  Northern Europeans still use it because it makes their springerle and gingerbread cookies very light and crisp.  Unfortunately, it can impart an unpleasant ammonia flavor, so it's best used in cookies and pastries that are small enough to allow the ammonia odor to dissipate while baking.  
Look for it in German or Scandinavian markets, drug stores, baking supply stores, or a mail order catalogue.  Don't confuse this with ordinary household ammonia, which is poisonous.  Varieties:  It comes either as lumps or powder.  If it isn't powdered, crush it into a very fine powder with a mortar and pestle or a rolling pin.","ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium carbonate, baking ammonia, bicarbonate of ammonia, carbonate of ammonia, hartshorn, hartzhorn, hirschhornsalz, hjorthornssalt, powdered baking ammonia, salt of hartshorn, triebsalz",,"baking powder,baking soda",miscellaneous
baking powder,"Baking powder is a mixture of one or more acidic salts and baking soda, an alkali.  These two compounds react when they get wet and release carbon dioxide gas bubbles. These, in turn, cause baked goods to rise.  Baking powder is perishable. To test a batch, add 1 teaspoon to ½ cup hot water. If it doesn't bubble, throw it out.  Look for baking powder among the baking supplies in most supermarkets.
Most recipes that call for baking powder intend for you to use double-acting baking powder.  This includes two acidic salts--one that reacts when wet and one that reacts heated.  By giving the baking soda two chances to react, it usually results in light and airy baked goods.  Less common is single-acting baking powder, which only reacts when it becomes wet. When using this kind of baking powder, you have to get the batter into a preheated oven immediately after you mix the wet and dry ingredients together.  Aluminum-free baking powder is preferred by many cooks; powders made with aluminum lend an unpleasant flavor to delicately-flavored baked goods","double-acting baking powder, single-acting baking powder",,"cream of tartar,cream of tartar,buttermilk,molasses",miscellaneous
baking soda,"Baking soda is alkaline, and when mixed with acidic ingredients, it reacts and releases bubbles of carbon dioxide.  These bubbles, when trapped inside batter, help baked goods rise.  Baking powder contains baking soda, along with acidic salts that react with the soda when they get wet or heated.   Recipes that call for both baking powder and baking soda are probably using the baking soda to offset extra acidity in the batter (from ingredients like buttermilk or molasses) and to weaken the proteins in the flour.  Omitting the baking soda from these recipes may alter the color or flavor of whatever you're baking, and make it less tender.
Tips: Baking soda is used in devil's food cake because it turns the cocoa powder reddish brown.  
Vegetables cooked in water mixed with baking soda don't lose as much color, though the baking soda makes them mushier and causes them to lose vitamin C.  
Sprinkling baking soda on a grease or electrical fire will help extinguish it.
Placing an opened box in the refrigerator or freezer will absorb bad odors 
Baking soda is a good, mildly abrasive scouring powder.
Store baking soda in a cool, dry place.","bicarb, bicarbonate of soda, bread soda, sodium bicarbonate",,potassium bicarbonate,miscellaneous

caviar,"Over-fishing in the Caspian Sea has greatly depleted sturgeon populations. Please consider using roe from more abundant species until the Caspian Sea sturgeon populations can recover.Caviar is known for its subtle, buttery flavor, sensuous texture, and high price. It should always be served cold.Just as diamonds are rated according to the four Cs, caviar can be evaluated by the three Fs--flavor, firmness, and freshness. The flavor of caviar depends on the sturgeon's species and habitat, and is variously described as buttery, nutty, sweet, fruity, earthy, briny, and even herbaceous. The firmness of each egg determines how the eggs burst when you squeeze them against the roof of your mouth with your tongue. Fresh caviar is considered much better than the pasteurized version.Varieties: (from highest to lowest price) imperial caviar, beluga caviar, ossetra caviar, and sevruga caviar. Imperial caviar is the rarest and most expensive. Beluga caviar is soft, and almost melts in your mouth. Ossetra and sevruga caviars are relatively firm, and will pop when gently squeezed. Within these categories, malossol, or lightly salted caviar, is of higher quality than pressed caviar = payusnaya.If substituting an inferior caviar, consider perking it up with a splash of fresh lemon juice.Equivalents: 2 tablespoons = 1 ounceFresh caviar lasts just over a year if properly stored, though its shelf-life can be extended with heavy salting. Experts claim that some of the fresh caviar that's being sold at bargain prices over the Internet is well past its prime. The color and size of the eggs--called the bead--can help you (and your guests) identify the different varieties of caviar.","Malossol caviar, payusnaya caviar, pressed caviar, sturgeon roe",,"hackleback roe,paddlefish roe,salmon roe,lumpfish roe,bowfin roe",miscellaneous

ClearJel,"This modified cornstarch is the secret ingredient that many commercial bakers use in their fruit pie fillings. Unlike ordinary cornstarch, ClearJel® works well with acidic ingredients, tolerates high temperatures, and doesn't cause pie fillings to weep"" during storage. ClearJel® is an especially good choice if you're canning homemade pie fillings, since it doesn't begin thickening until the liquid begins to cool. This allows the heat the be more evenly distributed within the jar during processing. This is such an important safety advantage that ClearJel® is the only thickener the USDA recommends for home canning. You can also use ClearJel® to thicken sauces, stews, and the like, though it's a rather expensive all-purpose thickener. One downside is that products thickened with ClearJel® tend to break down if they're frozen and thawed. If you plan to freeze what you're making, use Instant ClearJel®, arrowroot, or tapioca starch.

Starch thickeners,"Notes: These silky powders are used to thicken sauces, gravies, pie fillings, and puddings. They're popular because they thicken without adding fat or much flavor.
To avoid lumps, mix the starch with an equal amount of cold liquid until it forms a paste, then whisk it into the liquid you're trying to thicken. Once the thickener is added, cook it briefly to remove the starchy flavor. Don't overcook--liquids thickened with some starches will thin again if cooked too long or at too high a temperature.
Cornstarch, arrowroot, and tapioca are the most popular starch thickeners. They have different strengths and weaknesses, so it's a good idea to stock all three in your pantry.
Starch thickeners give food a transparent, glistening sheen, which looks nice in a pie filling, but a bit artificial in a gravy or sauce. If you want high gloss, choose tapioca or arrowroot. If you want low gloss, choose cornstarch.
Cornstarch is the best choice for thickening dairy-based sauces. Arrowroot becomes slimy when mixed with milk products.
Choose arrowroot if you're thickening an acidic liquid.  Cornstarch loses potency when mixed with acids.
Sauces made with cornstarch turn spongy when they're frozen. If you plan to freeze a dish, use tapioca starch or arrowroot as a thickener. 
Starch thickeners don't add much flavor to a dish, although they can impart a starchy flavor if they're undercooked. If you worried that your thickener will mask delicate flavors in your dish, choose arrowroot. It's the most neutral tasting of the starch thickeners.

Tips:
Before you add a thickener to a sauce, skim the fat from the top.  Once you've added the thickener, the fat will be harder to remove.
Flour is a good thickener for gravies, gumbos, and stews, since it gives them a smooth, velvety texture.   It's best to mix it with fat first, either by making a roux or beurre manié, or by flouring and frying stew meat before adding a liquid to the pot.  If you wish to cut fat from your diet, you can instead mix the flour with water and add it to the sauce, but you'll need to cook it for quite awhile to get rid of the starchy, raw flour taste.  Sauces thickened with flour become opaque, and they may become become thin again if they're cooked too long or if they're frozen and then thawed.
Starch thickeners like cornstarch are mixed with an equal amount of cold water, then added to warm liquids to thicken them.   They're a good choice if you want a low-fat, neutral-tasting thickener.  They give dishes a glossy sheen, which looks wonderful if you're making a dessert sauce or pie filling, but a bit artificial in a gravy or stew.
If you get lumps in your sauce from a thickener, blend the sauce in a blender or food processor until it's smooth.
Cereal grains like oatmeal, couscous, soup pasta, farina, are often used to thicken soups.  
Reduction is a slow but low-fat way of thickening sauces and concentrating flavors.  Just cook down the sauce in an uncovered pan until it's thickened to your liking.
Meat and fish glaces are a time-consuming--or expensive, if you buy them ready-made--way of thickening and enriching sauces.  They're made by reducing stocks until they're thick and gelatinous. 

A good way to thicken soups or stews is to add grated starchy vegetables, or to purée the vegetables in the sauce.   

Nuts make good, flavorful thickeners for stews, though they're often expensive and high in fat.  Just grind them down to a flour or butter, and add them to the dish. 

Egg yolks add a silky, velvety texture to soups and sauces, but they'll turn into scrambled eggs if they're not introduced carefully into the hot liquid.  
Cream, once reduced, gives sauces a rich texture and flavor as it thickens them, but it's high in fat.  To make a low-fat cream sauce, use evaporated milk mixed with a starch thickener. 
Yogurt is a popular soup thickener in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.","liaisons, thickening agents",,,miscellaneous

caviar,"Over-fishing in the Caspian Sea has greatly depleted sturgeon populations. Please consider using roe from more abundant species until the Caspian Sea sturgeon populations can recover.Caviar is known for its subtle, buttery flavor, sensuous texture, and high price. It should always be served cold.Just as diamonds are rated according to the four Cs, caviar can be evaluated by the three Fs--flavor, firmness, and freshness. The flavor of caviar depends on the sturgeon's species and habitat, and is variously described as buttery, nutty, sweet, fruity, earthy, briny, and even herbaceous. The firmness of each egg determines how the eggs burst when you squeeze them against the roof of your mouth with your tongue. Fresh caviar is considered much better than the pasteurized version.Varieties: (from highest to lowest price) imperial caviar, beluga caviar, ossetra caviar, and sevruga caviar. Imperial caviar is the rarest and most expensive. Beluga caviar is soft, and almost melts in your mouth. Ossetra and sevruga caviars are relatively firm, and will pop when gently squeezed. Within these categories, malossol, or lightly salted caviar, is of higher quality than pressed caviar = payusnaya.If substituting an inferior caviar, consider perking it up with a splash of fresh lemon juice.Equivalents: 2 tablespoons = 1 ounceFresh caviar lasts just over a year if properly stored, though its shelf-life can be extended with heavy salting. Experts claim that some of the fresh caviar that's being sold at bargain prices over the Internet is well past its prime.

Dried Fruit,"Dried fruit is a terrific snack, but cooks also use it in everything from muffins to stews.  Drying has the obvious advantage of letting us enjoy our favorite fruit when it's out of season, but it also serves to concentrate the fruit's flavor and sugar.  Since high concentrations of sugar ward off bacteria, dried fruit can last up to a year without refrigeration.   If you live in a hot, dry climate, you can dry fruit just by leaving it out in the sun for a few days.  If not, you can use an oven or dehydrator.  Sulfur dioxide is sometimes added to the fruit to improve its shelf life and color.  If you're allergic to it, you can usually find unsulfured dried fruit at health food stores.  In a pinch, you can remove some of the sulfur by boiling treated dried fruit for a minute or so, then draining off the liquid.",,,nuts,fruit

Unfortunately, tree-ripened nectarines bruise easily, so most growers scrimp on flavor and pick and market them while they're still slightly underripe.  After buying nectarines, you're supposed to let them ripen for a couple of days at room temperature before eating them.  This makes them softer and juicier, but not sweeter.  Avoid buying nectarines that are too hard or that have green spots--a sign they were picked way too soon--or those that are bruised.

Olives,"A staple of Mediterranean cuisines, olives are most often eaten out of hand, though cooks also use them to flavor everything from pizzas to martinis.  Raw olives must be cured before they can be eaten, and the curing medium--usually lye, brine, or salt--affects their flavor and texture.  So too does the olive's degree of ripeness when it's picked.  Green olives are picked while unripe, which makes them denser and more bitter than brown or black olives, which stay on the tree until fully ripened.   Olives become bitter if they're cooked too long, so always add them to hot dishes at the last minute.   Opened cans or jars of olives should be refrigerated, but some olives can be stored at room temperature if they're submerged in brine or olive oil.",,Olea europaea,"cocktail onion,onion flakes,sun-dried tomatoes,capers",fruit

The rind should be heavy for its size, and free of bruises, soft spots, or cuts. To check for ripeness, look at the pale side of the melon (where it rested while it was growing)--it should be yellow, not white. If your market sells halved watermelons, inspect the flesh--it should be firm, brightly colored, and free of white streaks. Seeded watermelons should have dark brown or black seeds. To store, wrap watermelon slices loosely in plastic and refrigerate for up to two days.

agar,"Since gelatin is made from animal tissue, many vegetarians rely upon this seaweed derivative as a substitute.  Like ordinary gelatin, agar is flavorless and becomes gelatinous when it's dissolved in water, heated, and then cooled.   Agar, though, gels more firmly than gelatin, and it sets and melts at a higher temperature--it can even set at room temperature.  Agar, like gelatin, is full of protein (though incomplete), but it also contains the rich array of minerals one would expect from seaweed.   To use agar, just soak it in the liquid for about 15 minutes, bring it to a gentle boil, then simmer while stirring until it's completely dissolved.  The liquid will gel as it cools.  Acids weakens agar's gelling power, so if you're firming an acidic liquid, use more.  Like gelatin, agar will break down if exposed to the enzymes of certain raw fruits, like kiwi fruit, papayas, pineapple, peaches, mangos, guavas, and figs.  Cooking these fruits, though, destroys the enzymes.  If you plan to add any of these fruits to a gelatin salad, it's a good idea to buy them in cans, since all canned fruit is pre-cooked.   Agar comes in flakes, powder, or bars.","agar agar, agar-agar, angel's hair, Chinese gelatin, Chinese isinglass, dai choy goh, Japanese gelatin, Japanese isinglass, kanten, vegetable gelatin",,gelatin,grain-products

arrowroot starch,"This starch thickener has several advantages over cornstarch. It has a more neutral flavor, so it's a good thickener for delicately flavored sauces. It also works at a lower temperature, and tolerates acidic ingredients and prolonged cooking better. And while sauces thickened with cornstarch turn into a spongy mess if they're frozen, those made with arrowroot can be frozen and thawed with impunity. The downside is that arrowroot is pricier than cornstarch, and it's not a good thickener for dairy-based sauces, since it turns them slimy. 
Arrowroot also imparts a shiny gloss to foods, and while it can make a dessert sauce glow spectacularly, it can make a meat sauce look eerie and fake. To thicken with arrowroot, mix it with an equal amount of cold water, then whisk the slurry into a hot liquid for about 30 seconds. Look for it in Asian markets and health food stores. Equivalents: One tablespoon thickens one cup of liquid. Substitutes: tapioca starch (very similar) OR Instant ClearJel® OR cornstarch (Cornstarch doesn't impart as glossy a finish and can leave a starchy taste if undercooked.)

ClearJel,"This modified cornstarch is the secret ingredient that many commercial bakers use in their fruit pie fillings. Unlike ordinary cornstarch, ClearJel® works well with acidic ingredients, tolerates high temperatures, and doesn't cause pie fillings to weep"" during storage. ClearJel® is an especially good choice if you're canning homemade pie fillings, since it doesn't begin thickening until the liquid begins to cool. This allows the heat the be more evenly distributed within the jar during processing. This is such an important safety advantage that ClearJel® is the only thickener the USDA recommends for home canning. You can also use ClearJel® to thicken sauces, stews, and the like, though it's a rather expensive all-purpose thickener. One downside is that products thickened with ClearJel® tend to break down if they're frozen and thawed. If you plan to freeze what you're making, use Instant ClearJel®, arrowroot, or tapioca starch.

Instead, you need to ""temper"" them by adding some of the hot liquid to the egg yolks, whisking the mixture together, and then adding it to the sauce.

If you plan to add these fruits to a gelatin salad, it's often easiest to buy them in cans, for all canned fruit is pre-cooked.

Others, like cherries and some berries, need an extra boost to firm up.  Jam recipes for pectin-deficient fruit normally call for liquid or powdered pectin, which you can find among the baking supplies in most supermarkets.  The recipes usually specify what brand of pectin to use, and it's not a good idea to substitute one brand for another, since they have different formulas.  Some brands (like Sure Jell and Certo) need acid and sugar to set, some (like Sure Jell for Low Sugar Recipes) need acid and just a little sugar to set, some (like Pomona's Universal Pectin® or Mrs. Wages Lite Home Jell Fruit Pectin®) don't need any sugar to set.

Some cooks use cooking spray instead of butter between the layers to trim fat and calories.  The dough dries out quickly, so work fast once you've opened the package, and cover any unused dough with plastic wrap topped with a damp towel.  Use fresh dough if you can find it; it doesn't tear as easily as the frozen kind.

Starch thickeners,"Notes: These silky powders are used to thicken sauces, gravies, pie fillings, and puddings. They're popular because they thicken without adding fat or much flavor.
To avoid lumps, mix the starch with an equal amount of cold liquid until it forms a paste, then whisk it into the liquid you're trying to thicken. Once the thickener is added, cook it briefly to remove the starchy flavor. Don't overcook--liquids thickened with some starches will thin again if cooked too long or at too high a temperature.
Cornstarch, arrowroot, and tapioca are the most popular starch thickeners. They have different strengths and weaknesses, so it's a good idea to stock all three in your pantry.
Starch thickeners give food a transparent, glistening sheen, which looks nice in a pie filling, but a bit artificial in a gravy or sauce. If you want high gloss, choose tapioca or arrowroot. If you want low gloss, choose cornstarch.
Cornstarch is the best choice for thickening dairy-based sauces. Arrowroot becomes slimy when mixed with milk products.
Choose arrowroot if you're thickening an acidic liquid.  Cornstarch loses potency when mixed with acids.
Sauces made with cornstarch turn spongy when they're frozen. If you plan to freeze a dish, use tapioca starch or arrowroot as a thickener. 
Starch thickeners don't add much flavor to a dish, although they can impart a starchy flavor if they're undercooked. If you worried that your thickener will mask delicate flavors in your dish, choose arrowroot. It's the most neutral tasting of the starch thickeners.

This isn't a problem in a two-crust pies, but the blobs are more noticeable in single-crust pies. Tapioca starch is finely ground so that it dissolves completely, eliminating the gelatinous blob problem. The starch is also sometimes used to thicken soups, stews, and sauces, but the glossy finish looks a bit unnatural in these kinds of dishes.

Tips:
Before you add a thickener to a sauce, skim the fat from the top.  Once you've added the thickener, the fat will be harder to remove.
Flour is a good thickener for gravies, gumbos, and stews, since it gives them a smooth, velvety texture.   It's best to mix it with fat first, either by making a roux or beurre manié, or by flouring and frying stew meat before adding a liquid to the pot.  If you wish to cut fat from your diet, you can instead mix the flour with water and add it to the sauce, but you'll need to cook it for quite awhile to get rid of the starchy, raw flour taste.  Sauces thickened with flour become opaque, and they may become become thin again if they're cooked too long or if they're frozen and then thawed.
Starch thickeners like cornstarch are mixed with an equal amount of cold water, then added to warm liquids to thicken them.   They're a good choice if you want a low-fat, neutral-tasting thickener.  They give dishes a glossy sheen, which looks wonderful if you're making a dessert sauce or pie filling, but a bit artificial in a gravy or stew.
If you get lumps in your sauce from a thickener, blend the sauce in a blender or food processor until it's smooth.
Cereal grains like oatmeal, couscous, soup pasta, farina, are often used to thicken soups.  
Reduction is a slow but low-fat way of thickening sauces and concentrating flavors.  Just cook down the sauce in an uncovered pan until it's thickened to your liking.
Meat and fish glaces are a time-consuming--or expensive, if you buy them ready-made--way of thickening and enriching sauces.  They're made by reducing stocks until they're thick and gelatinous. 

A good way to thicken soups or stews is to add grated starchy vegetables, or to purée the vegetables in the sauce.   

Nuts make good, flavorful thickeners for stews, though they're often expensive and high in fat.  Just grind them down to a flour or butter, and add them to the dish. 

Egg yolks add a silky, velvety texture to soups and sauces, but they'll turn into scrambled eggs if they're not introduced carefully into the hot liquid.  
Cream, once reduced, gives sauces a rich texture and flavor as it thickens them, but it's high in fat.  To make a low-fat cream sauce, use evaporated milk mixed with a starch thickener. 
Yogurt is a popular soup thickener in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.","liaisons, thickening agents",,,grain-products

Rice,"Rice is the most important food crop in Asia.  It can be cooked whole and served with stir-fries, sauces, and curries, or made into flour, wine, cakes, vinegar, milk, flakes, noodles, paper, and tea. 

Rice is classified mostly by the size of the grain. Long-grain rice is long and slender. The grains stay separate and fluffy after cooking, so this is the best choice if you want to serve rice as a side dish, or as a bed for sauces. Medium-grain rice is shorter and plumper, and works well in paella and risotto.   Short-grain rice is almost round, with moist grains that stick together when cooked. It's the best choice for rice pudding and molded salads.  Other specialty varieties include Spanish rice for paella, glutinous rice for sushi and rice balls, and risotto rice for risotto. Most varieties are sold as either brown or white rice, depending upon how they are milled.   Brown rice retains the bran that surrounds the kernel, making it chewier, nuttier, and richer in nutrients.   White rice lacks the bran and germ, but is more tender and delicate. It's less nutritious than brown rice, but you can partially compensate for that by getting enriched white rice. Brown rice takes about twice as long to cook as white rice. Converted rice is beige. It tastes a lot like white rice, but it has more nutrients. Instant rice is white rice that's been precooked and dehydrated.

Keep doing this for about two hours, until the water no longer changes color.   Alternatively, you can soak the shelled acorns in several changes of water for three or four days.  Some Native Americans do this by putting whole or pounded acorns into nylon stockings and hanging them so that they're immersed in the water of a toilet tank (repeat:  tank, not bowl).  Each time the toilet is flushed, the water in the tank is refreshed.  This may discolor the toilet, however.  After the nuts have been leached of tannins, roast them in a 350° oven for about an hour.  They can then be eaten whole or ground into acorn meal and used to make porridges or breads.

They appear fresh in the fall and winter, but you can find them dried, vacuum-packed, or canned throughout the year. Before you can eat them, fresh chestnuts need to be boiled or roasted, and then shelled and peeled. To roast them, cut an X into each shell (to allow steam to escape) and bake them in a 400° oven for about twenty minutes. While they're still warm, peel off both the shell and the furry skin surrounding each nut. Alternatively, boil the chestnuts for about 15 minutes, then remove them from the water with a slotted spoon. Peel off the shells and put the nuts back in the boiling water for another minute, then remove them again and peel off the skins. Select fresh chestnuts that are shiny and heavy for their size.

There are ways to enjoy beans without having to forego social appointments, however.  One is to change the water from time to time while you're soaking or cooking the beans.   Pouring off the water helps gets rid of the indigestible complex sugars that create gas in your intestine.  It also helps to cook the beans thoroughly, until they can be easily mashed with a fork.

beer,"Most beers are brewed from malted barley and flavored with hops, which makes them slightly bitter.

cream,"Creams vary according to the amount of butterfat they have. Lightest of all is half & half, which is half milk, half cream and weighs in with a butterfat content between 10.5 - 18%.  It can't be whipped, but it's nice with coffee, or on cereal.  Light cream = coffee cream = table cream is richer at 18 - 30% fat, but it still can't be whipped.  Light whipping cream = whipping cream (with a butterfat content of 30 - 36%) and heavy cream = heavy whipping cream (with at least 36% fat) are heavy enough to whip, and aren't as prone as lower-fat creams to curdling in sauces. The higher the butterfat content, the less beating is required to get whipped cream.  Europeans go for even heavier creams, like double cream (with a butterfat content of 42%), extra-thick double cream, and clotted cream = Devonshire cream, which is often spread like butter over scones.

Sulfured molasses has sulfur dioxide added as a preservative. Light molasses = mild molasses = sweet molasses = Barbados molasses is taken from the first boiling. It's the sweetest and mildest, and is often used as a pancake syrup or a sweetener for beverages. Dark molasses = full molasses = full-flavored molasses is left behind after the juices are boiled a second time. It's less sweet but more flavorful than light molasses, and it's a good choice if a recipe simply calls for molasses. Sugar-beet molasses is very bitter and is mostly used as cattle feed or as a medium for growing yeast. When measuring molasses, grease the cup and utensils to keep molasses from sticking. If your molasses crystallizes while being stored, heat it gently to dissolve the crystals.

Raw milk isn't pasteurized; producers instead keep their cows and dairies clean in order to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination. Some people insist raw milk is more healthful than commercial milk since it contains active enzymes that help with digestion and absorption of nutrients.

Examples include Amoroso and cream sherry, both of which are sweetened and especially popular in Britain.  Once bottled, sherry doesn't age well, so you should plan to use it no more than a year or two after you buy it.   Once opened, fino sherries should be consumed within a few days and stored in the refrigerator.  Oloroso sherries can be stored a bit longer, say a week.

wine,"Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of fruit, usually grapes.  There are four broad categories:  table wines, sparkling wines, fortified wines, and fruit wines.  Table wines are the most common, and they're grouped by color--red, white, and blush, which is sometimes called rosé.  A red wine should be served at room temperature, and it goes well with hearty, meat-based dishes like steak and spaghetti.  White and blush wines should be served chilled, and they go best with lighter fare, like fish and chicken.  Many wines, called varietals, are named after the variety of grape used to make them.  Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, and Pinot Noir are popular red varietals, while Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, and Johannisberg Riesling are popular white ones.  In Europe, some wines, often blends of different varietals, are named after the place where the wine is produced, like Bordeaux, Burgundy, Chablis, Rhine, and Rhône.  These European wines are often superb, but American wines that have borrowed these regional names, like California Chablis, are almost always mediocre.

tongue,"Cooked tongue is lean, meaty, and quite versatile; it works well in sandwiches, tacos, and casseroles.  To prepare it, boil it in a stockpot, then plunge it in cold water and peel off the skin and trim the base of gristle and fat.  You can then cut it into thin slices and serve it hot or cold.  Since beef tongue = ox tongue and calf's tongue = calf tongue = veal tongue are larger and easier to slice, they tend to be pricier.  Many markets also carry lamb tongue (pictured at left) and pork tongue.  Different tongues can be used interchangeably in recipes though their cooking times vary according to their size.","beef tongue, calf tongue, calf's tongue, ox tongue, veal tongue",,,meats

tripe,"Tripe is the name given to the stomachs of various animals, but most recipes that call for it intend for you to use beef tripe.  Cows have four stomachs, and the first three yield merchantable tripe.  Blanket tripe = plain tripe = flat tripe = smooth tripe comes from the first stomach, honeycomb tripe (pictured at left) and pocket tripe from the second, and book tripe = bible tripe = leaf tripe from the third.  Honeycomb tripe is meatier and more tender than the other kinds and considered to be the best, but all these kinds of tripe can be used interchangeably in recipes.  Tripe is almost always sold bleached and partially cooked.  This saves a lot of work, since unprocessed tripe would need to be cooked for many, many hours to make it tender enough to chew.","bible tripe, Blanket tripe, book tripe, flat tripe, honeycomb tripe, leaf tripe, plain tripe, pocket tripe, smooth tripe",,,meats
turkey,"Markets often sell whole turkeys at bargain prices during the holidays, using them as loss leaders. It's a good idea to stock up on them then, since you can keep them in the freezer for up to a year and serve your family this cheap, lean meat year-round. If you're planning to roast a whole turkey, choose a young turkey. Older birds (including yearlings) aren't as tender and are best cooked in a stew or soup. When selecting your turkey, make sure that the plastic wrapping isn't torn. There's no big difference between males (toms) and females (hens). Experienced cooks like fresh birds (since they're moister) that are between ten and twelve pounds. Bigger ones are tricky to cook without drying them out. Frozen turkeys should be thawed in the refrigerator, allowing one day of thawing per five pounds of bird. If you're short of time, you can thaw a turkey by leaving it in its original plastic wrapper and covering it completely with cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes. Allow 30 minutes of thawing time per pound of bird if you use this method. Fresh turkeys should be used within two days of purchase. Cut-up turkeys are also available. The major cuts are the turkey breast, tenderloin, cutlet, drumstick, and thigh.","fryer-roaster turkey, mature turkey, old turkey, yearling turkey, young hen turkey, young tom turkey, young turkey",Meleagris gallopavo domesticus,"chicken,goose,pheasant,ostrich,tofurky,UnTurkey",meats
