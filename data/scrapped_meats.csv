25,beef brisket,"Northerners like to use the brisket to make corned beef, but Southerners often prefer to barbecue it because they like the way the meat pulls apart into tender, juicy strands.

34,beef eye round steak,"This is a small, boneless steak cut from an eye round roast. It's tough, so it's sometimes cut into stew meat or processed into cube steak. It's also good braised, but it will require the tenderizing effects of a marinade if you want to grill or broil it. If cut thinly, this steak is sometimes called a breakfast steak = wafer steak = sandwich steak = minute steak.","breakfast steak, eye of round steak, eye round steak, eye steak, minute steak, sandwich steak, wafer steak",Bos taurus,"['beef top blade steak', 'beef top sirloin steak', 'beef round tip steak']"
35,beef filet mignon,"These are cut from the tenderloin, and they're the most tender steaks you can buy, though not the most flavorful.  American butchers usually call all  tenderloin steaks filets mignons, but the French reserve the name for just the cuts at the small end of the tenderloin, which is the best part.  As they move away from the filet mignon, the French call their cuts tournedos, filet steak, châteaubriand, and bifteck.  American butchers confuse matters even more by sometimes calling top sirloin steaks châteaubriands.

37,beef hanger steak,"This is the part of the diaphragm that hangs between the last rib and the loin.   It's often ground in hamburger (or butchers just take it home), but some people claim that its grainy texture and intense flavor make it a first-rate steak (if marinated first).   It's better known in France than in the United States, so you'll probably have to ask your butcher to set one aside for you.","butcher's steak, butcher's tenderloin, hanger steak, hanging tender, onglet",Bos taurus,"['beef skirt steak', 'beef flank steak']"

40,beef kidney,"Beef kidneys are tougher than lamb or veal kidneys, so they need to be cooked slowly using moist heat, say by braising them or adding them to a stew.  To prepare them, first cut off the outer membrane, then cut them lengthwise to expose a white blob of fat in the middle, which should be discarded.  Next, soak the kidney in acidulated water or buttermilk for about an hour.  This will make the flavor much more mild.",,Bos taurus,"['pork kidneys', 'lamb kidneys', 'veal kidneys']"

42,beef London broil,"This is the name of a finished dish, not a cut of meat, but butchers sometimes assign the name ""London broil"" to the following cuts: flank steak, top round steak, or top blade steak.

47,beef rib roast,"The entire rib section includes seven ribs, but it's usually cut into smaller chunks.  Each rib will feed about two people, so if you're feeding, say, six people, you should get a three-rib roast.  You can buy this cut as a standing rib roast, with the bones left in, or as a rolled rib roast, which is boned, then rolled and tied.  The nice thing about a standing rib roast is that it can stand by itself in the oven pan without a rack, plus the bones provide added flavor.  A large end rib roast  is cut from the part of the rib section nearest the chuck, so the steaks are bigger but tougher.  The small end rib roast = sirloin tip roast includes the ribs next to the choice loin section, so the meat's more tender and lean.  If the short ribs are lopped off of a rib roast, you get a half standing rib roast.   A steak cut from a rib roast is called a rib steak.","half standing rib roast, large end rib roast, rib roast, rib steak, rolled rib roast, sirloin tip roast, small end rib roast, standing rib roast",Bos taurus,"['beef rib-eye roast', 'veal rib roast', 'beef top loin', 'beef tenderloin roast']"
48,beef rib steak,"Rib steaks are cut from rib roast, and shouldn't be confused with rib-eye steaks, which have less fat and bone.  Rib steaks are sometimes called club steaks, though that name is usually reserved for a different cut from the loin.","entrecote, rib steak",Bos taurus,"['beef club steak', 'beef rib-eye steak']"
49,beef rib-eye roast,"The juicy rib-eye comes from the same muscle that gives us those exquisite top loin and top sirloin cuts.

Rib-eye roasts are very tender, well marbled with fat, and fairly expensive.","Delmonico roast, rib-eye roast",Bos taurus,"['beef tenderloin roast', 'beef rib roast']"
50,beef rib-eye steak,"Rib-eye steaks are very tender, well marbled with fat, and fairly expensive.  They're usually boneless, but you can sometimes find bone-in rib-eye steaks.

51,beef roast beef,"Several cuts are well suited to oven roasting. The most elegant choice is a tenderloin roast, which is lean and tender, but very expensive. A rib roast (sometimes called a prime rib roast) isn't as lean and tender, but it's juicier and more flavorful. A good compromise between the two would be a rib-eye roast, which is basically a boneless, low-fat rib roast. Other candidates for roast beef are a top loin roast, top sirloin butt roast, tri-tip roast, round tip roast, and rump roast. Don't assume that anything with ""roast"" in its name will work as roast beef. Some roasts are intended for pot roast recipes, for it takes hours of cooking in a liquid to make them tender enough for civilized consumption.",roast beef,Bos taurus,"['beef tenderloin roast', 'beef rib-eye roast', 'beef pot roast', 'beef top round roast', 'beef top sirloin butt roast', 'beef tri-tip roast', 'beef round tip roast']"

53,beef round tip roast,"This roast is just a cut away from the sirloin, so it's tender enough to be oven roasted or cut up into kabobs. If the roast is trimmed of some fat and muscle, it's called a trimmed tip roast = ball tip roast.","ball tip roast, round tip roast, sirloin tip roast, tip roast, tip sirloin roast, trimmed tip roast",Bos taurus,"['beef tri-tip roast', 'beef rump roast']"
54,beef round tip steak,"This is a steak cut from an untrimmed round tip roast. If the steak is cut from a trimmed roast, it's called a trimmed tip steak = ball tip steak. If you first marinate them overnight, you can grill, broil, or pan-fry these steaks. If not, your best bet is to braise them or cut them into stew meat.","ball tip steak, round tip steak, trimmed tip steak",Bos taurus,"['beef top blade steak', 'beef top sirloin steak', 'beef eye round steak']"
55,beef rump roast,"This is cut from the bottom round.  A rump roast with the bone left in is called a standing rump roast.

57,beef short loin,"The loin is divided into two main parts: the short loin, which includes the choice tenderloin and top loin, and the sirloin, which lies closer to the rump. Since the muscles in the short loin don't get much of a workout, the meat there is very tender.",short loin,Bos taurus,"['beef tenderloin roast', 'beef top loin', 'beef sirloin steak']"
58,beef short ribs,"These are rectangular sandwiches of fat, meat, and bone that are often cut into three-inch sections.  They're very flavorful, but tough and fatty, so they're best if slowly braised.  You can also grill them over low heat, but the dripping fat tends to cause flare-ups.  To prevent this, either braise the ribs first or put a drip pan under them.  Short ribs are sold either boneless or bone-in.  If the cut is made across the ribs instead of between the ribs, the result is called flanken style ribs = kosher ribs = brust flanken = flanken short ribs.

61,beef sirloin steak,"The sirloin is near the rump, so the meat's a bit tougher than cuts from the loin or the rib.  There are several different sirloin steak cuts, named for shape of the hip bone that's left in them.  Going from fore to aft, there's  the tender but bony pin bone sirloin, which is right next to the Porterhouse on the carcass, the flat bone sirloin, the round bone sirloin, and finally the wedge bone sirloin, which is closest to the rump and therefore least tender.

62,beef skirt steak,"These look like thick-grained flank steaks, and they're the cut of choice for making fajitas.  Since they're marbled with fat, they also make for very juicy steaks.

73,beef tri-tip roast,"This is a very flavorful cut that's great for barbecuing as long as you take pains to keep the meat from getting too tough.

307,tongue,"Cooked tongue is lean, meaty, and quite versatile; it works well in sandwiches, tacos, and casseroles.  To prepare it, boil it in a stockpot, then plunge it in cold water and peel off the skin and trim the base of gristle and fat.  You can then cut it into thin slices and serve it hot or cold.  Since beef tongue = ox tongue and calf's tongue = calf tongue = veal tongue are larger and easier to slice, they tend to be pricier.  Many markets also carry lamb tongue (pictured at left) and pork tongue.  Different tongues can be used interchangeably in recipes though their cooking times vary according to their size.","beef tongue, calf tongue, calf's tongue, ox tongue, veal tongue",,[]

311,tripe,"Tripe is the name given to the stomachs of various animals, but most recipes that call for it intend for you to use beef tripe.  Cows have four stomachs, and the first three yield merchantable tripe.  Blanket tripe = plain tripe = flat tripe = smooth tripe comes from the first stomach, honeycomb tripe (pictured at left) and pocket tripe from the second, and book tripe = bible tripe = leaf tripe from the third.  Honeycomb tripe is meatier and more tender than the other kinds and considered to be the best, but all these kinds of tripe can be used interchangeably in recipes.  Tripe is almost always sold bleached and partially cooked.  This saves a lot of work, since unprocessed tripe would need to be cooked for many, many hours to make it tender enough to chew.","bible tripe, Blanket tripe, book tripe, flat tripe, honeycomb tripe, leaf tripe, plain tripe, pocket tripe, smooth tripe",,[]
312,turkey,"Markets often sell whole turkeys at bargain prices during the holidays, using them as loss leaders. It's a good idea to stock up on them then, since you can keep them in the freezer for up to a year and serve your family this cheap, lean meat year-round. If you're planning to roast a whole turkey, choose a young turkey. Older birds (including yearlings) aren't as tender and are best cooked in a stew or soup. When selecting your turkey, make sure that the plastic wrapping isn't torn. There's no big difference between males (toms) and females (hens). Experienced cooks like fresh birds (since they're moister) that are between ten and twelve pounds. Bigger ones are tricky to cook without drying them out. Frozen turkeys should be thawed in the refrigerator, allowing one day of thawing per five pounds of bird. If you're short of time, you can thaw a turkey by leaving it in its original plastic wrapper and covering it completely with cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes. Allow 30 minutes of thawing time per pound of bird if you use this method. Fresh turkeys should be used within two days of purchase. Cut-up turkeys are also available. The major cuts are the turkey breast, tenderloin, cutlet, drumstick, and thigh.","fryer-roaster turkey, mature turkey, old turkey, yearling turkey, young hen turkey, young tom turkey, young turkey",Meleagris gallopavo domesticus,"['chicken', 'goose', 'pheasant', 'ostrich', 'tofurky', 'UnTurkey']"
