5,arrowroot starch,"This starch thickener has several advantages over cornstarch. It has a more neutral flavor, so it's a good thickener for delicately flavored sauces. It also works at a lower temperature, and tolerates acidic ingredients and prolonged cooking better. And while sauces thickened with cornstarch turn into a spongy mess if they're frozen, those made with arrowroot can be frozen and thawed with impunity. The downside is that arrowroot is pricier than cornstarch, and it's not a good thickener for dairy-based sauces, since it turns them slimy. 
Arrowroot also imparts a shiny gloss to foods, and while it can make a dessert sauce glow spectacularly, it can make a meat sauce look eerie and fake. To thicken with arrowroot, mix it with an equal amount of cold water, then whisk the slurry into a hot liquid for about 30 seconds. Look for it in Asian markets and health food stores. Equivalents: One tablespoon thickens one cup of liquid. Substitutes: tapioca starch (very similar) OR Instant ClearJel® OR cornstarch (Cornstarch doesn't impart as glossy a finish and can leave a starchy taste if undercooked.) OR kudzu powder OR potato starch OR rice starch OR flour (Flour makes an opaque sauce, imparts a floury taste, and can easily turn lumpy. Use twice as much flour as arrowroot.)","arrowroot, arrowroot flour, arrowroot powder",,"['tapioca starch', 'Instant Clearjel', 'corn starch', 'kudzu powder', 'potato starch', 'flour', 'rice starch']"
6,baker's ammonia,"Originally made from the ground antlers of reindeer, this is an ancestor of modern baking powder.  Northern Europeans still use it because it makes their springerle and gingerbread cookies very light and crisp.  Unfortunately, it can impart an unpleasant ammonia flavor, so it's best used in cookies and pastries that are small enough to allow the ammonia odor to dissipate while baking.  
Look for it in German or Scandinavian markets, drug stores, baking supply stores, or a mail order catalogue.  Don't confuse this with ordinary household ammonia, which is poisonous.  Varieties:  It comes either as lumps or powder.  If it isn't powdered, crush it into a very fine powder with a mortar and pestle or a rolling pin.","ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium carbonate, baking ammonia, bicarbonate of ammonia, carbonate of ammonia, hartshorn, hartzhorn, hirschhornsalz, hjorthornssalt, powdered baking ammonia, salt of hartshorn, triebsalz",,"['baking powder', 'baking soda']"
7,baking powder,"Baking powder is a mixture of one or more acidic salts and baking soda, an alkali.  These two compounds react when they get wet and release carbon dioxide gas bubbles. These, in turn, cause baked goods to rise.  Baking powder is perishable. To test a batch, add 1 teaspoon to ½ cup hot water. If it doesn't bubble, throw it out.  Look for baking powder among the baking supplies in most supermarkets.
Most recipes that call for baking powder intend for you to use double-acting baking powder.  This includes two acidic salts--one that reacts when wet and one that reacts heated.  By giving the baking soda two chances to react, it usually results in light and airy baked goods.  Less common is single-acting baking powder, which only reacts when it becomes wet. When using this kind of baking powder, you have to get the batter into a preheated oven immediately after you mix the wet and dry ingredients together.  Aluminum-free baking powder is preferred by many cooks; powders made with aluminum lend an unpleasant flavor to delicately-flavored baked goods","double-acting baking powder, single-acting baking powder",,"['cream of tartar', 'cream of tartar', 'buttermilk', 'molasses', ""baker's ammonia""]"
8,baking soda,"Baking soda is alkaline, and when mixed with acidic ingredients, it reacts and releases bubbles of carbon dioxide.  These bubbles, when trapped inside batter, help baked goods rise.  Baking powder contains baking soda, along with acidic salts that react with the soda when they get wet or heated.   Recipes that call for both baking powder and baking soda are probably using the baking soda to offset extra acidity in the batter (from ingredients like buttermilk or molasses) and to weaken the proteins in the flour.  Omitting the baking soda from these recipes may alter the color or flavor of whatever you're baking, and make it less tender.
Tips: Baking soda is used in devil's food cake because it turns the cocoa powder reddish brown.  
Vegetables cooked in water mixed with baking soda don't lose as much color, though the baking soda makes them mushier and causes them to lose vitamin C.  
Sprinkling baking soda on a grease or electrical fire will help extinguish it.
Placing an opened box in the refrigerator or freezer will absorb bad odors 
Baking soda is a good, mildly abrasive scouring powder.
Store baking soda in a cool, dry place.","bicarb, bicarbonate of soda, bread soda, sodium bicarbonate",,['potassium bicarbonate']

10,banana leaves,"People in the tropics use these huge leaves to line cooking pits and to wrap everything from pigs to rice.  The leaves impart a subtle anise fragrance to food and protect it while it's cooking.  Frozen leaves--once thawed--work just fine.  Boil the leaves before using them to keep them from cracking.

11,beluga caviar,"In recent years, over-fishing in the Caspian Sea has greatly depleted sturgeon populations. Please consider using caviar and roe from more abundant species until the Caspian Sea sturgeon populations can recover.Beluga caviar is one of the best and priciest of the caviars. The eggs are large and bluish-grey, and slightly sweet. A pasteurized version is available in jars, but fresh caviar is much better.

19,caviar,"Over-fishing in the Caspian Sea has greatly depleted sturgeon populations. Please consider using roe from more abundant species until the Caspian Sea sturgeon populations can recover.Caviar is known for its subtle, buttery flavor, sensuous texture, and high price. It should always be served cold.Just as diamonds are rated according to the four Cs, caviar can be evaluated by the three Fs--flavor, firmness, and freshness. The flavor of caviar depends on the sturgeon's species and habitat, and is variously described as buttery, nutty, sweet, fruity, earthy, briny, and even herbaceous. The firmness of each egg determines how the eggs burst when you squeeze them against the roof of your mouth with your tongue. Fresh caviar is considered much better than the pasteurized version.Varieties: (from highest to lowest price) imperial caviar, beluga caviar, ossetra caviar, and sevruga caviar. Imperial caviar is the rarest and most expensive. Beluga caviar is soft, and almost melts in your mouth. Ossetra and sevruga caviars are relatively firm, and will pop when gently squeezed. Within these categories, malossol, or lightly salted caviar, is of higher quality than pressed caviar = payusnaya.If substituting an inferior caviar, consider perking it up with a splash of fresh lemon juice.Equivalents: 2 tablespoons = 1 ounceFresh caviar lasts just over a year if properly stored, though its shelf-life can be extended with heavy salting. Experts claim that some of the fresh caviar that's being sold at bargain prices over the Internet is well past its prime. The color and size of the eggs--called the bead--can help you (and your guests) identify the different varieties of caviar.","Malossol caviar, payusnaya caviar, pressed caviar, sturgeon roe",,"['hackleback roe', 'paddlefish roe', 'salmon roe', 'lumpfish roe', 'bowfin roe']"

23,ClearJel,"This modified cornstarch is the secret ingredient that many commercial bakers use in their fruit pie fillings. Unlike ordinary cornstarch, ClearJel® works well with acidic ingredients, tolerates high temperatures, and doesn't cause pie fillings to weep"" during storage. ClearJel® is an especially good choice if you're canning homemade pie fillings, since it doesn't begin thickening until the liquid begins to cool. This allows the heat the be more evenly distributed within the jar during processing. This is such an important safety advantage that ClearJel® is the only thickener the USDA recommends for home canning. You can also use ClearJel® to thicken sauces, stews, and the like, though it's a rather expensive all-purpose thickener. One downside is that products thickened with ClearJel® tend to break down if they're frozen and thawed. If you plan to freeze what you're making, use Instant ClearJel®, arrowroot, or tapioca starch. ClearJel® is available either as pearls or powder from mail-order suppliers, but it's not yet available in grocery stores.","Clear-jel, ClearJel® starch",,"['Instant Clearjel', 'tapioca starch', 'arrowroot starch', 'corn starch']"

26,corn starch,"One tablespoon (1/4 ounce) thickens one cup of liquid.  Notes:   This silky powder is used to thicken sauces, gravies, and puddings.  Like other starch thickeners, cornstarch should be mixed into a slurry with an equal amount of cold water before it's added to the hot liquid you're trying to thicken.  You then need to simmer the liquid, stirring constantly, for a minute or so until it thickens.   Cornstarch doesn't stand up to freezing or prolonged cooking, and it doesn't thicken well when mixed with acidic liquids.  Cornstarch is called cornflour or maize cornflour in Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.  Don't confuse cornstarch with the finely ground cornmeal that Americans call corn flour","corn starch, cornflour, crème de mais, maize cornflour",Zea mays,"['arrowroot starch', 'Instant Clearjel', 'tapioca starch', 'potato starch', 'kudzu powder', 'flour', 'water chestnut starch', 'almond powder']"
27,corn tortilla,"These thin round wraps are widely used in southern Mexico, and they're the preferred tortilla for making tacos and enchiladas.  They should be served hot.   If you're watching calories, do this by cooking them on a hot, dry frying pan or by wrapping them in moist paper towels and briefly heating them in a microwave oven.  If calories aren't an issue, fry them in oil.  You can make corn tortillas at home if you have a tortilla press.  Just mix masa harina with enough water to make a bread-like dough, press the dough until it's very thin, and then cook the tortilla in a hot, dry frying pan.

33,egg yolks,"Higher in fat, but increasing the egg yolks in a baked good often makes it moister and more flavorful.
Egg yolks make wonderful thickeners--imparting both a rich flavor and velvety smooth texture--but they're tricky to use.  You can't just whisk them into a simmering sauce--they'd curdle on contact.  Instead, you need to ""temper"" them by adding some of the hot liquid to the egg yolks, whisking the mixture together, and then adding it to the sauce.  To prevent the yolks from coagulating, you need to keep the sauce below 190°, although this rule can be broken if the sauce has a lot of flour in it.  Finally, never cook sauces with egg yolks in aluminum pans or they'll turn gray.",,Gallus gallus domesticus,['egg']

If the balls are a problem, just pulverize the instant tapioca in a coffee grinder or blender, or buy tapioca starch, which is already finely ground. Instant tapioca tolerates prolonged cooking and freezing, and gives the fillings an attractive glossy sheen. To use it in a pie filling, mix it with the other ingredients, then let it sit for at least five minutes so that the tapioca can absorb some of the liquid.

Commercial malt powders are usually made with barley, and they're used extensively by commercial bakers.  There are two main types of malt powder:  diastatic and non-diastatic.  Diastatic malt contains active enzymes which help break starch down into sugar.  The extra sugar feeds the yeast in the dough, helping the bread to rise, and also gives the bread a browner crust.  It's often used to make crusty breads.  Non-diastatic malt doesn't have active enzymes, but it gives baked goods better flavor and a shinier, browner crust. It's used in everything from bagels to croissants to breakfast cereals.

Some fruits -- like quinces, gooseberries, tart apples, and sour plums -- contain enough natural pectin that they'll thicken all by themselves into preserves.  Others, like cherries and some berries, need an extra boost to firm up.  Jam recipes for pectin-deficient fruit normally call for liquid or powdered pectin, which you can find among the baking supplies in most supermarkets.  The recipes usually specify what brand of pectin to use, and it's not a good idea to substitute one brand for another, since they have different formulas.  Some brands (like Sure Jell and Certo) need acid and sugar to set, some (like Sure Jell for Low Sugar Recipes) need acid and just a little sugar to set, some (like Pomona's Universal Pectin® or Mrs. Wages Lite Home Jell Fruit Pectin®) don't need any sugar to set.

129,Starch thickeners,"Notes: These silky powders are used to thicken sauces, gravies, pie fillings, and puddings. They're popular because they thicken without adding fat or much flavor.
To avoid lumps, mix the starch with an equal amount of cold liquid until it forms a paste, then whisk it into the liquid you're trying to thicken. Once the thickener is added, cook it briefly to remove the starchy flavor. Don't overcook--liquids thickened with some starches will thin again if cooked too long or at too high a temperature.
Cornstarch, arrowroot, and tapioca are the most popular starch thickeners. They have different strengths and weaknesses, so it's a good idea to stock all three in your pantry.
Starch thickeners give food a transparent, glistening sheen, which looks nice in a pie filling, but a bit artificial in a gravy or sauce. If you want high gloss, choose tapioca or arrowroot. If you want low gloss, choose cornstarch.
Cornstarch is the best choice for thickening dairy-based sauces. Arrowroot becomes slimy when mixed with milk products.
Choose arrowroot if you're thickening an acidic liquid.  Cornstarch loses potency when mixed with acids.
Sauces made with cornstarch turn spongy when they're frozen. If you plan to freeze a dish, use tapioca starch or arrowroot as a thickener. 
Starch thickeners don't add much flavor to a dish, although they can impart a starchy flavor if they're undercooked. If you worried that your thickener will mask delicate flavors in your dish, choose arrowroot. It's the most neutral tasting of the starch thickeners.

135,tapioca pearls,"These round pellets are made from cassava roots. Asians use them to make puddings and a beverage called bubble tea.

136,tapioca starch,"Tapioca is a good choice for thickening pie fillings, since it thickens at a lower temperature than cornstarch, remains stable when frozen, and imparts a glossy sheen. Many pie recipes call for instant tapioca instead of tapioca starch, but instant tapioca doesn't dissolve completely and leaves small gelatinous blobs suspended in the liquid. This isn't a problem in a two-crust pies, but the blobs are more noticeable in single-crust pies. Tapioca starch is finely ground so that it dissolves completely, eliminating the gelatinous blob problem. The starch is also sometimes used to thicken soups, stews, and sauces, but the glossy finish looks a bit unnatural in these kinds of dishes. It works quickly, though, so it's a good choice if you want to correct a sauce just before serving it. Some recipes for baked goods also call for tapioca flour because it imparts a chewier texture.","almidon de yuca, cassava flour, tapioca flour, yucca starch",Manihot esculenta,"['Instant flour', 'instant tapioca', 'Instant Clearjel', 'sweet rice flour', 'corn starch', 'arrowroot starch', 'potato starch', 'rice starch']"

Tips:
Before you add a thickener to a sauce, skim the fat from the top.  Once you've added the thickener, the fat will be harder to remove.
Flour is a good thickener for gravies, gumbos, and stews, since it gives them a smooth, velvety texture.   It's best to mix it with fat first, either by making a roux or beurre manié, or by flouring and frying stew meat before adding a liquid to the pot.  If you wish to cut fat from your diet, you can instead mix the flour with water and add it to the sauce, but you'll need to cook it for quite awhile to get rid of the starchy, raw flour taste.  Sauces thickened with flour become opaque, and they may become become thin again if they're cooked too long or if they're frozen and then thawed.
Starch thickeners like cornstarch are mixed with an equal amount of cold water, then added to warm liquids to thicken them.   They're a good choice if you want a low-fat, neutral-tasting thickener.  They give dishes a glossy sheen, which looks wonderful if you're making a dessert sauce or pie filling, but a bit artificial in a gravy or stew.
If you get lumps in your sauce from a thickener, blend the sauce in a blender or food processor until it's smooth.
Cereal grains like oatmeal, couscous, soup pasta, farina, are often used to thicken soups.  
Reduction is a slow but low-fat way of thickening sauces and concentrating flavors.  Just cook down the sauce in an uncovered pan until it's thickened to your liking.
Meat and fish glaces are a time-consuming--or expensive, if you buy them ready-made--way of thickening and enriching sauces.  They're made by reducing stocks until they're thick and gelatinous. 

A good way to thicken soups or stews is to add grated starchy vegetables, or to purée the vegetables in the sauce.   

Nuts make good, flavorful thickeners for stews, though they're often expensive and high in fat.  Just grind them down to a flour or butter, and add them to the dish. 

Egg yolks add a silky, velvety texture to soups and sauces, but they'll turn into scrambled eggs if they're not introduced carefully into the hot liquid.  
Cream, once reduced, gives sauces a rich texture and flavor as it thickens them, but it's high in fat.  To make a low-fat cream sauce, use evaporated milk mixed with a starch thickener. 
Yogurt is a popular soup thickener in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.","liaisons, thickening agents",,[]
139,ThickenThin™,"This thickener has no calories, fat, or carbohydrates.  It's great for thickening gravies, sauces, and soups, but it won't set up sufficiently to make puddings or custards.
