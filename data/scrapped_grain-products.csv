2,agar,"Since gelatin is made from animal tissue, many vegetarians rely upon this seaweed derivative as a substitute.  Like ordinary gelatin, agar is flavorless and becomes gelatinous when it's dissolved in water, heated, and then cooled.   Agar, though, gels more firmly than gelatin, and it sets and melts at a higher temperature--it can even set at room temperature.  Agar, like gelatin, is full of protein (though incomplete), but it also contains the rich array of minerals one would expect from seaweed.   To use agar, just soak it in the liquid for about 15 minutes, bring it to a gentle boil, then simmer while stirring until it's completely dissolved.  The liquid will gel as it cools.  Acids weakens agar's gelling power, so if you're firming an acidic liquid, use more.  Like gelatin, agar will break down if exposed to the enzymes of certain raw fruits, like kiwi fruit, papayas, pineapple, peaches, mangos, guavas, and figs.  Cooking these fruits, though, destroys the enzymes.  If you plan to add any of these fruits to a gelatin salad, it's a good idea to buy them in cans, since all canned fruit is pre-cooked.   Agar comes in flakes, powder, or bars.","agar agar, agar-agar, angel's hair, Chinese gelatin, Chinese isinglass, dai choy goh, Japanese gelatin, Japanese isinglass, kanten, vegetable gelatin",,['gelatin']

14,arrowroot starch,"This starch thickener has several advantages over cornstarch. It has a more neutral flavor, so it's a good thickener for delicately flavored sauces. It also works at a lower temperature, and tolerates acidic ingredients and prolonged cooking better. And while sauces thickened with cornstarch turn into a spongy mess if they're frozen, those made with arrowroot can be frozen and thawed with impunity. The downside is that arrowroot is pricier than cornstarch, and it's not a good thickener for dairy-based sauces, since it turns them slimy. 
Arrowroot also imparts a shiny gloss to foods, and while it can make a dessert sauce glow spectacularly, it can make a meat sauce look eerie and fake. To thicken with arrowroot, mix it with an equal amount of cold water, then whisk the slurry into a hot liquid for about 30 seconds. Look for it in Asian markets and health food stores. Equivalents: One tablespoon thickens one cup of liquid. Substitutes: tapioca starch (very similar) OR Instant ClearJel® OR cornstarch (Cornstarch doesn't impart as glossy a finish and can leave a starchy taste if undercooked.) OR kudzu powder OR potato starch OR rice starch OR flour (Flour makes an opaque sauce, imparts a floury taste, and can easily turn lumpy.

Rinse the noodles in cold water after they're done and let them drain.  Toss them about to prevent them from sticking together, then fry them, or add them to your stir-fry or soup.

This is such an important safety advantage that ClearJel® is the only thickener the USDA recommends for home canning. You can also use ClearJel® to thicken sauces, stews, and the like, though it's a rather expensive all-purpose thickener.

Some fruits -- like quinces, gooseberries, tart apples, and sour plums -- contain enough natural pectin that they'll thicken all by themselves into preserves.  Others, like cherries and some berries, need an extra boost to firm up.  Jam recipes for pectin-deficient fruit normally call for liquid or powdered pectin, which you can find among the baking supplies in most supermarkets.  The recipes usually specify what brand of pectin to use, and it's not a good idea to substitute one brand for another, since they have different formulas.  Some brands (like Sure Jell and Certo) need acid and sugar to set, some (like Sure Jell for Low Sugar Recipes) need acid and just a little sugar to set, some (like Pomona's Universal Pectin® or Mrs. Wages Lite Home Jell Fruit Pectin®) don't need any sugar to set.

Some cooks use cooking spray instead of butter between the layers to trim fat and calories.  The dough dries out quickly, so work fast once you've opened the package, and cover any unused dough with plastic wrap topped with a damp towel.  Use fresh dough if you can find it; it doesn't tear as easily as the frozen kind.

286,Starch thickeners,"Notes: These silky powders are used to thicken sauces, gravies, pie fillings, and puddings. They're popular because they thicken without adding fat or much flavor.
To avoid lumps, mix the starch with an equal amount of cold liquid until it forms a paste, then whisk it into the liquid you're trying to thicken. Once the thickener is added, cook it briefly to remove the starchy flavor. Don't overcook--liquids thickened with some starches will thin again if cooked too long or at too high a temperature.
Cornstarch, arrowroot, and tapioca are the most popular starch thickeners. They have different strengths and weaknesses, so it's a good idea to stock all three in your pantry.
Starch thickeners give food a transparent, glistening sheen, which looks nice in a pie filling, but a bit artificial in a gravy or sauce. If you want high gloss, choose tapioca or arrowroot. If you want low gloss, choose cornstarch.
Cornstarch is the best choice for thickening dairy-based sauces. Arrowroot becomes slimy when mixed with milk products.
Choose arrowroot if you're thickening an acidic liquid.  Cornstarch loses potency when mixed with acids.
Sauces made with cornstarch turn spongy when they're frozen. If you plan to freeze a dish, use tapioca starch or arrowroot as a thickener. 
Starch thickeners don't add much flavor to a dish, although they can impart a starchy flavor if they're undercooked. If you worried that your thickener will mask delicate flavors in your dish, choose arrowroot. It's the most neutral tasting of the starch thickeners. 
Tapioca starch thickens quickly, and at a relatively low temperature. It's a good choice if you want to correct a sauce just before serving it.",,,"['roux', 'Instant flour', 'potato', 'nut flour']"

This isn't a problem in a two-crust pies, but the blobs are more noticeable in single-crust pies. Tapioca starch is finely ground so that it dissolves completely, eliminating the gelatinous blob problem. The starch is also sometimes used to thicken soups, stews, and sauces, but the glossy finish looks a bit unnatural in these kinds of dishes.

Tips:
Before you add a thickener to a sauce, skim the fat from the top.  Once you've added the thickener, the fat will be harder to remove.
Flour is a good thickener for gravies, gumbos, and stews, since it gives them a smooth, velvety texture.   It's best to mix it with fat first, either by making a roux or beurre manié, or by flouring and frying stew meat before adding a liquid to the pot.  If you wish to cut fat from your diet, you can instead mix the flour with water and add it to the sauce, but you'll need to cook it for quite awhile to get rid of the starchy, raw flour taste.  Sauces thickened with flour become opaque, and they may become become thin again if they're cooked too long or if they're frozen and then thawed.
Starch thickeners like cornstarch are mixed with an equal amount of cold water, then added to warm liquids to thicken them.   They're a good choice if you want a low-fat, neutral-tasting thickener.  They give dishes a glossy sheen, which looks wonderful if you're making a dessert sauce or pie filling, but a bit artificial in a gravy or stew.
If you get lumps in your sauce from a thickener, blend the sauce in a blender or food processor until it's smooth.
Cereal grains like oatmeal, couscous, soup pasta, farina, are often used to thicken soups.  
Reduction is a slow but low-fat way of thickening sauces and concentrating flavors.  Just cook down the sauce in an uncovered pan until it's thickened to your liking.
Meat and fish glaces are a time-consuming--or expensive, if you buy them ready-made--way of thickening and enriching sauces.  They're made by reducing stocks until they're thick and gelatinous. 

A good way to thicken soups or stews is to add grated starchy vegetables, or to purée the vegetables in the sauce.   

Nuts make good, flavorful thickeners for stews, though they're often expensive and high in fat.  Just grind them down to a flour or butter, and add them to the dish. 

Egg yolks add a silky, velvety texture to soups and sauces, but they'll turn into scrambled eggs if they're not introduced carefully into the hot liquid.  
Cream, once reduced, gives sauces a rich texture and flavor as it thickens them, but it's high in fat.  To make a low-fat cream sauce, use evaporated milk mixed with a starch thickener. 
Yogurt is a popular soup thickener in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.","liaisons, thickening agents",,[]
308,ThickenThin™,"This thickener has no calories, fat, or carbohydrates.  It's great for thickening gravies, sauces, and soups, but it won't set up sufficiently to make puddings or custards. A little goes a long way, so use about half as much as you would a starch thickener.","NotStarch, ThickenThin not/Starch thickener™",,['corn starch']
309,thin rice sticks,"These are used throughout Asian in soups, spring rolls, cold salads, and stir-fries.  They're similar to bean threads, only they're longer and made with rice flour instead of mung bean starch.  Before using, soak the dried noodles in hot water until they're soft (about 15 minutes), then boil them briefly (from 1 to 3 minutes) and rinse with hot water. You can also deep-fry the dried noodles until they're crunchy and then use them in Chinese chicken salad, or as a garnish or bed for sauces.","bun, pancit palabok, sen yai, thin rice stick noodles, thin stick",,"['bean threads', 'rice noodles', 'vermicelli']"
